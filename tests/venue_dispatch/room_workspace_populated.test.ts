// A REALIZED ROOM'S WORKSPACE IS POPULATED WITH A WORKING TREE — and the repository is named by the
// RUN, not the room. Driven HERMETICALLY (no live daemon).
//
// The realizer's docker steps run through the injected `run` seam as no-ops, and every tree is cloned
// from a LOCAL bare repository (no network) — the same pattern tests/workspace.test.ts uses. What is
// under test is the DECISION about a working tree, not docker.
//
// TWO FAMILIES:
//
//   REALIZER-DIRECT (b/c/f) — the tree comes from the run-supplied source and NEVER from the host's
//       cwd (b); population routes through prepareWorkspace, the drain's own function (c); a run
//       naming no source declines to populate and mints nothing (f). These call realize() directly.
//
//   DISPATCH / DRAIN — the RUN names the repository, not the venue:
//       • DISPATCH-PATH LAW  — runGig (the dispatch path, not realize() directly) with a run naming a
//                              repository populates the seat's workspace with that repository's tree.
//       • ONE-TO-MANY LAW    — two gigs naming DIFFERENT repositories against the SAME venue each get
//                              their own correct, disjoint tree. This is the property a venue-pinned
//                              repo_url could never express.
//       • NO-REPOSITORY LAW  — a run naming no repository declines to populate: the room's populate
//                              path is never reached, no clone, no cwd fallback.
//       • COLLISION LAW      — a Booker claim AND a populating room in play mint EXACTLY ONE git
//                              credential (one clone) per gig: the Booker's clone is suppressed when
//                              the room will populate.
//       • BOOKER-UNCHANGED   — a run naming a repository but NO room keeps the Booker's own clone: a
//                              false-positive suppression would leave the drain with no tree at all.
//
// venue.repo_url has been REMOVED: the repository is a per-RUN fact (one venue serves many
// repositories), so `flooredRoom()` no longer sets it and the schema now REJECTS it.
