/**
 * `coltrane reside` — the standing loop.
 *
 * The state machine this drives already exists (src/residency.ts, 43 laws): states, ops, the
 * party-constrained transition table, the reflex, the reaper, the boot preflight. What did NOT exist
 * was a CALLER. `runReside` was exported, tested and pinned as law I20 while `src/cli.ts`'s KNOWN
 * table had no "reside" in it, so `coltrane reside` answered `unknown command` on a green suite —
 * a mechanism proven to work that nothing could reach. This module is the loop, and the mount in
 * cli.ts is the half that makes it reachable.
 *
 * THREE PROPERTIES THE SHAPE ENFORCES RATHER THAN REQUESTS:
 *
 *   1. NO MODEL ON THE REFLEX PATH. `onInbound` is SYNCHRONOUS. Not "does not call the cortex" as a
 *      matter of discipline — it cannot await, so it cannot reach one. An inbound message is acked
 *      and appended whether the cortex is busy, dead, or absent; an unacked message means the
 *      listener is down, which is a pager fact and must stay one.
 *
 *   2. EVERY SEAM IS INJECTED, AND AN UNWIRED SEAM IS A NAMED REFUSAL. The way `deps.queueGig`
 *      injects dispatch (src/server.ts:3436): the engine ships the loop, its refusals and its shape
 *      checks; a deployment supplies the backends. Absent must mean DECLINE — `{ok:false,
 *      refusal:"no_backend", seam}` in the gig_dispatch shape, naming which seam — never a throw and
 *      never a plausible default. `hosted_unsupported` is deliberately not reused: an unwired seam
 *      and an unsupported deployment are different facts.
 *
 *   3. THE ROUTER IS CODE. Determinism in the engine, inference in the prompt, no overlap. A clean
 *      pass dispatches every due (order, ordinal) and consults the cortex ZERO times. The cortex is
 *      reached on NAMED DEMAND only — a store refusal whose `law_ref` the deployment listed — and that
 *      is keyed on the law_ref, never on the refusal's prose, because prose is written for humans
 *      and gets reworded without notice.
 *
 * A NOTE ON THE IMPORT CYCLE. src/residency.ts re-exports `runReside` from here, and this module
 * imports the state machine from there. The cycle is safe and deliberate: every binding crossing it
 * is either a hoisted function declaration or read inside a function body at call time, never during
 * module evaluation. The alternative was duplicating the transition table, which is the one thing
 * the surface's identity laws exist to forbid.

 *
 *   1. THE EAR IS NEVER BLOCKED BY THE MIND. The pump calls `onInbound` (synchronous, so it cannot
 *      reach a model) and then KICKS a drain it does not await. A cortex turn that takes 900 seconds
 *      does not stop the next message being acked — which is the whole reason the reflex was built
 *      synchronous, and would have been given away by a pump that awaited its own wake.
 *
 *   2. THE DRAIN IS SINGLE-FLIGHT AND SELF-EXTENDING. One drain runs at a time; its `while` re-reads
 *      `inbox.length` every turn, so messages that arrive mid-wake are picked up by the drain already
 *      running rather than racing a second one. Two concurrent drains would both wake on the same
 *      cursor, and the second would be refused `illegal_transition` — a correct refusal for an
 *      incorrect caller.
 *
 *   3. A SIGNAL ENDS THE PUMP WITHOUT CANCELLING IT. A socket listener never returns, so the loop
 *      RACES the pump against a stop promise rather than pretending an async iterator can be
 *      cancelled. The seat is handed back once, whatever ends first.
 *
 * Exit codes are `resideExitCode`'s, unchanged: 0 released cleanly, 2 a seam or a claim the
 * deployment misconfigured, 3 nothing claimable, 1 the cortex failed mid-life.
