// RED-first — Item 3, WIRE `yielding`: BudgetState.agent_state declares the member "yielding" with
// its own comment ("below cost-of-next-append, paused (used when partial)"), and grep of the whole
// tree finds it in exactly two places — that comment (runtime.ts:402) and the type union
// (runtime.ts:413). Nothing sets it, nothing reads it, no gig has ever been told it is yielding. It
// is a declared rule with no enforcement — the exact defect class lineage-record 03cacf6a names.
//
// THE DECISION THIS SPEC FIXES (D1): a chair-in-reserve and a gig-that-is-yielding are ONE condition
// seen at two scales, not two concepts. A gig is `yielding` IFF at least one seated chair is
// currently drawing its reserve. It enters yielding the moment a seated chair crosses from its
// budget into a granted reserve draw (budget_reserve_granted fires), clears back to `active` when
// that chair lands within its reserve, and moves to `depleted` when the chair spends its reserve
// (and the pool) without landing. This is the gig-scale projection of Item 2's chair-scale draw —
// the reactive observed state (Kubernetes' memory-limit shape), never an in-band gate.
//
// Covers contract INV14, INV15, INV16, INV17 and F8, plus the written D1 decision made executable
// as the INV15 biconditional. RED because agent_state only ever reaches active/depleted/settled in
// code today; the draw event is forwarded as an opaque agent_event and never moves the state.
