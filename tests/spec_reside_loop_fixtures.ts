//
// WHY THIS SHAPE — the same reason spec_reside_fixtures.ts has it, and it is worth restating because
// the failure it avoids is the one this work item exists to close. The root tsconfig compiles
// tests/** into the shared build, so a static `import … from "../src/reside.js"` of an absent module
// breaks the build for the ENTIRE suite rather than isolating these files. And a top-level `await
// import()` that REJECTS inside beforeAll fails the FILE, after which vitest reports its laws as
// `skipped` — laws that never ran, in a state that reads as legitimate rather than as red. So the
// loader returns a THROWING PROXY: every law stays individually executable and fails where it
// actually asserts, naming the absent module. When src/reside.ts is authored this branch never runs
// and each law becomes a live check against the real callsite.
