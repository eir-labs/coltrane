      //
      //   • `write()` adds the gig to `hydratedGigs`, so a file this process WROTE is never
      //     read back. In production the MCP server is long-lived with a persistDir, so every
      //     gig a process ran was exempt from the corruption scan for that process's life —
      //     precisely the torn-append-from-a-crash case #248 exists to catch. The old code
      //     answered `{ok:true, scanned:0}` for a directory full of its own output.
      //   • `hydrateGig` skips a gig it has already PARSED, so a torn append to a gig this
      //     process already read would not be re-read by the reads themselves. (The old
      //     `fullyHydrated` latch made this worse — it cached the WHOLE first scan for the
      //     process's life; that latch is gone, but per-gig parse-skipping remains, so an
      //     honest damage report still cannot rely on read side effects.)
      //
      // A damage report has to describe the bytes now, not the bytes we happened to have
      // cached. `scanFile` re-reads a file whose (size, mtime) has moved since we last looked
      // and stats the rest, so this is a fresh answer without being a blind full re-read.
      //
      // That distinction is load-bearing, not an optimisation. `system_health` is the first
      // thing CLAUDE.md tells an operator to run, and it goes through the MCP relay — which
      // has a known handoff race after `server_restart` (#170). Measured against the real
      // outputs dir (4,595 files / 5.6 MB), an unconditional re-read added ~110 ms to every
      // call and made that race fire in 1 run of 4 where clean main passed 6 of 6. A guard
