// This is the other half of Gap 2 (SPEC-worker-contract.md): a venue declares WHICH substrate it
// needs, a deployment declares WHICH substrates it provides, and this module refuses the mismatch
// rather than degrading silently. A venue that requires isolation, realized on a substrate that
// cannot provide it, RUNS and believes it is isolated — a false guarantee is strictly worse than a
// refusal, because a guarantee is exactly the thing a venue's author reasons against.
//
// The renderer is pinned from both directions: it EMITS only from a closed allowlist, so a forbidden
// setting cannot appear from contract data; and it REFUSES input that smuggles a forbidden value
// through an allowlisted FIELD, because an allowlist over field NAMES says nothing about what those
// fields CONTAIN. Rendering a runtime configuration from contract data is code generation from data,
// and if any part of the input is reachable by a gig, a permissive renderer is remote code execution
// with extra steps.

  // The workspace above is bind-mounted `rw` from a HOST directory the drain mkdirs, so on Linux it
  // is owned by whoever ran the drain (uid 501 on a laptop, ~1001 on a GitHub runner). The image runs
  // as `USER node` = uid 1000. Those uids MISMATCH, so a seat exec'd into the room could not write its
  // own workspace on Linux — the isolation law's in-room write (spec_venue_room_live.test.ts) exited
  // non-zero. macOS Docker Desktop translates ownership across the mount and hid it; Linux does not,
  // so this only surfaced in CI.
  //
  // ★ DO NOT REINTRODUCE A chown FROM THE HOST. A NON-ROOT process on Linux CANNOT chown a file to
  // another uid — a drain running as `runner` cannot hand its workspace to uid 1000, so any
  // host-side `chown` works on a root drain and fails on every other one. The fix must not require
  // the host to own the workspace to a different uid.
  //
  // Instead, pin the container's user to the invoking uid:gid. The container then owns its own bind
  // mount by construction and the in-room write succeeds, WITHOUT the host chowning anything. This
  // stays NON-ROOT (the posture that matters — asserted live by the not-root law): it is simply no
  // longer specifically `node`. Nothing in the room/floor image depends on uid 1000 — /app and
  // /run/secrets/<class> are world-readable (COPY lands root-owned 0644; credential files are mode
  // 0o444), so a non-1000 uid still reads the genome and its credentials.
  //
  // Direction (b) — make the workspace a NAMED VOLUME so Docker creates it with the container's
  // ownership and host-path exposure drops entirely — is the better END STATE, but it changes
  // seat.workspace from a host absolute path to a container-relative one and its callers (notably
