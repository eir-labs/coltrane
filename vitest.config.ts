// Root vitest config — runs only the fast unit suite; the other bands have their own configs
// and their own scripts, and `npm run verify` runs all of them:
//
//   vitest.config.ts (this file)          npm test / npm run verify
//   tests/failure_modes/vitest.config.ts  npm run test:failure-modes
//   tests/honest_broker/vitest.config.ts  npm run test:honest-broker
//   tests/security/vitest.config.ts       npm run test:security       (spend gated on COLTRANE_LIVE)
//   tests/e2e/vitest.config.ts            npm run e2e                 (needs a live claude CLI)
//   tests/e2e/vitest.offline.config.ts    npm run e2e:offline
//
// tests/test_band_wiring.test.ts enforces that table: every test file is claimed by some
// config, every config is run by some script, and every script runs somewhere in CI or is
// exempted in writing. Add a band → add a script → or that guard goes red (#262).
//
// The excludes below are DELEGATIONS, not omissions: each excluded directory is owned by the
// config named above. tests/security/** in particular is not "skipped" — it is a real band
// with a real script and a real CI job; leaving it in this config would spawn the live CLI
// inside the fast unit suite.
//
// Coverage: opt-in via `vitest run --coverage`. Requires @vitest/coverage-v8 in
// devDependencies. Thresholds are intentionally absent on first land — measure
// the baseline first, gate on regressions later.
