// The worker environment contract, written down in ONE place — the fix for Gap 3 of
// SPEC-worker-contract.md.
//
// ONE VARIABLE, THREE READERS, TWO MEANINGS. `COLTRANE_DRAIN_URL` was read by callers that did not
// agree on what host it named — two treated it as the database's PostgREST base, one as the
// Coltrane service origin. Pointed at the database, rows wrote and the artifact 401'd forever;
// repointed at the service, provisioning broke against a 307. Every fix moved the failure because
// the variable had never named one thing.
//
// This module pins the general form of the fix rather than that instance of it:
//   * one variable names one host; two hosts are two variables (`WORKER_ENV_CONTRACT`);
//   * `COLTRANE_SERVICE_URL` is canonical and `COLTRANE_DRAIN_URL` survives only as a normalized
//     legacy alias — a role name is not a host name, which is how one variable came to hold both;
//   * a legacy shape NORMALIZES, never appends (`normalizeWorkerEnv`) — appending is what produced
//     `/rest/v1/rest/v1`;
//   * a misconfigured worker refuses at STARTUP in its own voice (`assertWorkerEnv`), rather than
//     learning it is pointed at the wrong host from a status code at its first write.
//
// The contract enumerates every variable the worker path reads. `tests/spec_worker_environment.test.ts`
// scans the real source of the WORKER_PATH files and fails if any `process.env["…"]` read is absent
// from this table — so the table is a declaration the code is held to, not a comment. This file
// therefore reads NO environment itself; its three functions take the environment as an argument.

/** Which host a value addresses — or "none" when it names no host at all. "model" is the
 *  chat-completions endpoint: a third host, named as one, because the whole point of this table is
 *  that one variable names one host and two hosts are two variables. */
