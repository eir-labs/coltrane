// Two-tier output persistence + retrieval — the reliable local mirror MCP traverses.
//
// The bug this closes: a CLI-dispatched gig sealed outputs to disk, but the payloads were not
// reliably retrievable through the MCP surface. This module makes every sealed output land in a
// content-addressed local store under `.coltrane/` (gitignored) that MCP reads seamlessly with
// NO remote configured, and — only when an append credential is present — ALSO drains the same
// record to a remote row + artifact store.
//
// Two tiers, by design:
//   • TIER 1 — a compact, queryable METADATA row, ALWAYS. id, gig_id, agent, phase, primitive,
//     domain_type, content_sha, a short preview, a storage_ref, cost/tokens, created_at. This
//     alone supports high-level traversal (`output_query`/`output_trace`) without loading a
//     single payload.
//   • TIER 2 — the full PAYLOAD, as a content-addressed artifact, fetched only on the deeper
//     second pass (`readPayload`, or `output_query { include_data:true }`).
//
// OSS stays pure: with no drain credential in the environment, ONLY the local tier runs and no
// new npm dependency is touched (the remote row goes over `fetch`; the optional Postgres path is
// a guarded dynamic import that is never reached unless a PG connection string is set).

 * The Coltrane SERVICE origin — the one host this box is allowed to know.

 * WHY NOT THE DATABASE. A drain holds exactly one credential: its issued, org-scoped,
 * instance-bound `cdk_` key. That key is an APPLICATION credential — resolved inside a SECURITY
 * DEFINER function against `coltrane_drain_key` — and Supabase has never heard of it. So the box
 * cannot address the project directly for anything, and every attempt to make it ends the same way:
 * by handing the box a SECOND credential. A project key. A Storage key. Which is the exact thing
 * the venue design exists to prevent.
 *
 * The app is the service seam. It exposes PostgREST- and Storage-SHAPED paths precisely so this
 * client needs no special cases and holds nothing privileged:
 *
 *   POST ${origin}/rest/v1/coltrane_outputs                     the sealed output rows
 *   POST ${origin}/rest/v1/coltrane_gigs                        the run's own header
 *   POST ${origin}/storage/v1/object/<bucket>/<gig>/<sha>.json  the payload artifact
 *
 * each with `Authorization: Bearer <cdk_…>` and nothing else. The app holds the privileged halves.
 *
 * HOW THIS WENT WRONG, because the repair reads exactly like the defect. The original laws pinned
 * these three requests. They answered 401 — and the diagnosis was that the SHAPE was wrong, so the
 * row writes were moved to `/rest/v1/rpc/<definer fn>` carrying the project's anon key as `apikey`.
 * That works, and it is worse than the bug: it routes around the service seam, puts a second
 * credential back on the box, and strands Storage — which has no definer function to call, because
 * Postgres cannot reach the Storage API — holding a `cdk_` key in an `apikey` header, 401 forever.
 *
 * The shape was never wrong. The HOST was.
