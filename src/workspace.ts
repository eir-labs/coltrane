/**
 * The working tree a gig runs in, obtained AFTER the claim.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `drain-loop.sh` cloned a repository BEFORE claiming, from a `REPO_URL` fixed in
 * the box's environment at provisioning. That made a per-gig fact a per-box one — the same category
 * error as the `worker_agent` the venue design already removed — and it meant every gig an
 * organization ever dispatched had to work in the same repository.
 *
 * The obvious repair, letting a gig name its own repository through `input_data`, was refused on
 * review and the reasons are worth keeping close to the code:
 *
 *   - `input_data` is authored under a gate asking "may this agent RUN this standard". That is not
 *     "may it WRITE this repository", and nobody had asked the second question.
 *   - `git clone` accepts `ext::sh -c '…'` as a URL. A gig-supplied string is command execution.
 *
 * So the STORE names the repository, on the claim, from a governed column. Nothing the gig carries
 * can influence it, because there is no field in which to carry it.
 *
 * AND THE CREDENTIAL IS FETCHED PER GIG, against a live lease. Not held at boot, not in the
 * container's environment, not the same one twice. A drain between gigs holds no git credential at
 * all — which is the property the per-gig store credential already has, extended to the half that
 * previously sat in a Fly secret for the life of the machine.

/**
 * Shallow-clone `repoUrl` into a fresh temp directory.

 * (`https://x-access-token:$TOKEN@github.com/…`) writes it verbatim into `.git/config` — inside the
 * very tree the gig's seats then read and write, one `git remote -v` away from model context. A
 * credential helper is consulted only when the server challenges, and reads the token from the
 * helper's own environment at that moment.
 *
 * The helper is supplied through GIT_CONFIG_* rather than `-c`, because `git clone -c k=v` writes k
 * into the NEW clone's .git/config — see the note at the call site. Scoped to `https://github.com`
 * so a URL naming any other host is never offered the token.
 *
 * `targetDir`, when given, is WHERE the clone lands — a caller-supplied directory instead of this
 * function's own throwaway tmpdir. It is the one addition a venue room needs over the drain: the room
 * clones into `<realizationDir>/workspace` (the seat's cwd, subsumed by the realizer's own teardown)
 * rather than a detached tmpdir. Everything else — the token-never-on-disk GIT_CONFIG_* path, cleanup,
 * revoke — is IDENTICAL, because a room's working tree and the drain's must be the same thing prepared
 * the same way. Omitted (the drain's call) keeps the original mkdtempSync behaviour byte-for-byte.
