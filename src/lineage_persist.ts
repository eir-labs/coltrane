/** Write an adopted lineage reference into an institution's genome document.
 *
 *  The LAST step of the chain, and the only one that touches a disk:
 *
 *    lineageAdoption      decides   — pass? signed? names a record? names an institution?
 *    applyLineageAdoption applies   — pure; returns a new document with the ref appended
 *    persistLineageAdoption writes  — this
 *    agentLineageGrounding inherits — the seated agent finally sees it
 *
 *  NOT WIRED INTO DISPATCH, deliberately. A gig that silently rewrites genome files would mutate
 *  a tree other sessions may be editing, and an implicit genome write is exactly the kind of act
 *  that should be visible in a command rather than a side effect of running a standard. Adoption
 *  is a governance act; persisting it is a second one, and the caller performs it on purpose.
 *
 *  This is also a STOPGAP and says so: LineageRecordRefSchema names `coltrane_institution_lineage`
 *  as the store-side home. Writing the genome file proves the loop end to end before a table
 *  exists, and a store-backed implementation replaces this without changing the three pure steps
 *  above it.
 *
 *  Fails closed on every ambiguity. An unresolved slug is a DEAD NAME — it writes nothing rather
 *  than creating an institution to hold a lineage nobody declared. A document whose shape is not
 *  what the loader expects is left alone rather than repaired, because a lineage write is not the
 *  place to discover a malformed institution. And re-adopting an already-present record reports
 *  `already-adopted` rather than touching the file, so re-running a signature is inert. */
