// Runtime accounting + provenance integrity — #232 #233 #235 #236 #240 #243 #245 #246.
//
// One theme runs through all eight: the runtime asserts a number (or a hash, or a status)
// that it does not actually know. A budget charges chairs that never ran; the cost basis
// measures UUIDs instead of content; `usage` says "$0.00 spent" when the truth is "not
// captured"; a failed gig reports zero dollars after burning real ones; backfillShas attaches
// a REAL content_sha belonging to the WRONG predecessor; a chair that under-delivers its
// promised outputs completes silently; a chair with an empty input_contract seals a
// hallucination; a typo'd eval slug scores 0.0 as though it had been judged and found wanting.
//
// Every test here runs the real runGig path with a stubbed invoker (the same template as
// tests/runtime_usage_and_provenance.test.ts) — no `claude` subprocess is ever spawned.

// #232 — REWRITTEN to the budget-in-dollars contract (operator decision 2026-09-16). The original
// #232 pinned an APPEND-UNIT reservation bug: budget was deducted at chair-PREP (`opening`/
// `base_cost`/`k`), so an eager `ready.map(prepareChair)` left earlier batch members charged for
// work no invoker started. The contract retires pre-invocation reservation entirely — there is no
// per-chair charge at prep; SETTLED USD is checked at BATCH BOUNDARIES (O2), and only chairs that
// actually ran and settled contribute to spend.
//
// The old phantom-charge law (a parallel batch whose third chair tripped the prep gate, so NONE ran
// and none were charged) has NO dollar analog: a parallel phase is ONE batch, the ceiling is checked
// before it starts, so either the whole batch runs or none of it does — there is no
// "prepared-but-not-invoked-yet-charged" state to catch. Its surviving property — "a chair that
// never started is never charged; the stop happens before the NEXT batch" — is already first-batch
// LAW 2 (I2) in tests/spec_budget_is_dollars.test.ts (three sequential $0.03 chairs vs a $0.05
// ceiling → exactly two start, then BudgetExhausted) together with I3 in
// tests/cost_budget_enforcement.test.ts (the running batch finishes and seals; the next never
// starts). So that law is DELETED here rather than duplicated.
//
// What survives with a genuinely distinct dollar equivalent is the post-success rule: a chair whose
// invocation THROWS settles no dollars. RED today because a `max_usd` budget is not enforced in
// dollars and the failed gig's snapshot reports the append-unit `spent`, never `spent_usd`.
