 * The enforcement half of `RunDeps`, assembled once so the two call sites cannot drift.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `runGig` takes its dependencies as a bag of optionals, and every absence has a
 * defensible-looking default. Read one call site and each omission looks deliberate. Read both side
 * by side and the drain — the path that runs queued work on an unattended box — was missing nine
 * wires the server had, three of which disable a control outright:
 *
 *   budget                            `runtime.ts:1149`  absent → enforcement OFF
 *   toolProviders / mcpServerConfigs  `runtime.ts:1208`  absent → grant resolution OFF, so a dead
 *                                                        tool name reaches the spawn instead of
 *                                                        failing closed
 *   signal                                               absent → no abort wiring; nothing stops a
 *                                                        running gig
 *
 * It survived because a drained gig's ledger still records `usage` and `settled_usd` accurately. It
 * reported spend it was never bounded by, which reads like working software.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT SHARED, AND WHY. `bootstrapServerDeps` builds `mcpServerConfigs` by reading
 * `.mcp.json` from the genome root. On the server that root is the operator's own checkout. On a
 * drain the cwd is a FRESHLY CLONED REPOSITORY — untrusted input — so sharing that function
 * wholesale would let a cloned repo declare MCP servers for the seat reading it, reintroducing
 * exactly what `--setting-sources user` was added to close. The drain therefore gets an EMPTY
 * server map: present, so resolution is on; empty, so a grant naming any server but the engine's
 * own fails closed. That is the correct posture for a box running work nobody is watching.

/**
 * WHICH REPOSITORY THIS GIG'S WORKING TREE IS. One home for the decision, shared by every door — the
 * drain reads it as `resolveWorkingRepo(claim)` and the dispatch door as
 * `resolveWorkingRepo({ input }, args['repo_url'])`, so a change-request's repository resolves the
 * SAME way however the gig arrived.
 *
 * The order is the fix, in three tiers:
 *   1. the TYPED input `repository` — a first-class field in every code-touching standard's input
 *      contract (domain_types/change-request.json, change-context.json). The correct value was always
 *      being passed; a direct dispatch was the door that ignored it.
 *   2. an EXPLICIT repo_url argument — the dispatch door's named override, honoured beneath the typed
 *      input and above the org default so `repo_url` on gig_dispatch keeps working as a fallback.
 *   3. the org column (`claim.repo_url`) — the store's per-organization default, so existing
 *      single-repo deployments keep working unchanged.
 *
 * Null is a normal answer, not a degraded one — a standard whose contract names no repository touches
 * no tree and mints no git credential, which is already correct for research work.
 *
 * `explicitRepoUrl` has a default initializer so `Function.length === 1`: the drain calls this with one
 * argument and tests/the_repo_is_typed_input pins that arity. `claim` is typed structurally (no
 * ClaimedGig import) so this shared module keeps its no-new-dependency posture.

/**
 * The SHARED run-deps every gig runs under, assembled once so the four call sites cannot drift.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `runGig` takes its dependencies as a bag of optionals, and `runGig` has four call
 * sites (server.ts sync + async dispatch, worker.ts drain, chart.ts movement), each of which used to
 * hand-assemble its own body. Read one and each omission looks deliberate; read them side by side and
 * they had already diverged — a wire added to one branch was carried to the other by a comment asking
 * the next reader to remember. This function is that shared body: every door builds its run-deps from
 * here, so a wire is INHERITED, not copied by reminder.
 *
 * The fields that legitimately DIFFER per door are supplied by explicit ARGUMENT, never defaulted:
 *   · `mcpServerConfigs` — empty on the drain (a freshly cloned, untrusted repo must not declare
 *     servers for the seat reading it; see the header above) and the bootstrap map on the server. A
 *     default would silently hand one door the wrong value — the exact class of hand-carried
 *     divergence this whole change exists to eliminate — so it is a REQUIRED argument.
 *   · the venue trio (`venue`/`venues`/`venueRealizer`) and `repoUrl` — conditionally spread so an
 *     absent one is threaded to nothing, keeping the venue-less / repo-less path byte-identical.
 *
 * DOOR-SPECIFIC fields (gig_id, signal, onProgress, depth, reuse/human wiring, resume_from,
 * seed_outputs, chart, checkpoints) are NOT here: each call site spreads its own onto this result. The
 * assembler unifies exactly the wires that diverged and no more.
