// Behavioral families — the inheritance mechanism for genome agents, as DATA + TEST,
// not as an engine feature.
//
// The family axis is not a new taxonomy: it's derived from what each agent already
// declares — its primitives and its substrate. A SENSE agent over an external substrate
// owes retrieval discipline and a real tool grant; a JUDGE owes evidence discipline; a
// CREATE owes no-new-facts discipline; a VERIFY owes ran-vs-reasoned discipline.
//
// Inheritance works in two halves:
//   1. AUTHORING — these canonical strings are expanded VERBATIM into each agent file,
//      so every agent file remains a self-contained, fully sealed behavioral contract.
//   2. ENFORCEMENT — tests/genome_behavioral_floor.test.ts asserts every agent carries
//      the families its primitives owe. The test IS the inheritance; it cannot drift.
//
// Changing a family string here without re-authoring the agent files turns the floor
// test red — that's the point.
