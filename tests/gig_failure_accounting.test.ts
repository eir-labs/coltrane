// #236 — settled spend is discarded on every failed gig.
//
// `usage` accumulates as chairs run, but it is written ONLY on the success path. The async
// failure path (src/server.ts) sets status/finished_at/error and never `state.usage`. Async is
// the default. So a gig that burns real dollars across four chairs and dies on the fifth
// reports ZERO dollars, everywhere — and per the consuming project's findings, failed runs are
// routine. Failed runs are exactly the ones whose cost matters most.
//
// The no-ledger-row-for-a-crashed-gig invariant (recorder_durability_mid_crash.spec.ts) is
// deliberate and stays: an un-sealed gig gets no row. This is about the LIVE state that
// gig_monitor reads, and about the partial usage riding on the thrown error.
