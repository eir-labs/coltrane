// RED — LAWS 7, 9 and 10 of WI-3: the work-order router is CODE, the lease token is not a gig
// token, and reside does not fork the gig path.
//
// The verb contract these laws encode is WI-4's, taken from spec.callVerb-residency.callVerb-binds-the-verbs
// (amendments a-c) rather than guessed:
//   work-order-due       args {}            — a row-routed READ; no pin, the credential is the header
//   work-order-dispatch  args {p_work_order_id, p_schedule_ordinal, p_mode?, p_input?, pin:{org,venue}} — the door's
//                        parameter names since 3 Oct 2026 (amendment (a)'s bare names were refused PGRST202 by the store)
//   gig_monitor          args {gig_id}
// Every refusal carries `message`; a store refusal also carries `errcode` and, when its message
// cites one, `law_ref`. Re-dispatching a (work_order_id, schedule_ordinal) that already has a
// standing non-terminal gig returns that gig's id — so "once per wake" is safe, not merely polite.
