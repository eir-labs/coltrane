/** DECLARED-FIELD REACHABILITY ENGINE — the enforcement the sealed law
 *  tests/declared_fields_are_read.test.ts demands. Pure Node `fs` + regex, no AST, no dependency,
 *  no network — the same technique as the sibling exported-symbols ratchet.
 *
 *  WHAT IT DOES. It enumerates every field NAME declared in three namespaces:
 *    (1) domain_types/*.json  — the keys of `schema.properties`
 *    (2) core_types/*.json    — the keys of `schema.properties`
 *    (3) src/genome_schema.ts — every field key inside a Zod `z.object({ … })` block
 *  and then cross-references each name (>= 5 chars) against whether ANY top-level `src/*.ts` file
 *  READS it — where READ means the word-boundary regex `\bname\b` matches anywhere in the
 *  concatenated text of those files. Every declared name with no such hit is reported BY NAME in
 *  `unread` (a bare count tells nobody what to fix), and the true count is pinned in
 *  PINNED_UNREAD_FIELDS as a ratchet floor that may only ever DECREASE.
 *
 *  FAIL-SAFE: AMBIGUOUS IS READ. This engine UNDER-reports on purpose. ANY word-boundary hit counts
 *  as a read — including a name that appears only inside an `Object.keys(x)` argument, only inside a
 *  spread `{...x}`, only inside a destructuring pattern, or only inside a `dynamic` `obj[key]` /
 *  `as { name: T }` type-assertion site. Precisely excluding those would need an AST (forbidden) and
 *  risks calling a genuinely-read field dead. The hydration defect hid for ten days inside exactly an
 *  `Object.keys` read, so the honesty contract is to err toward READ and never toward UNREAD. The
 *  pinned number is therefore a LOWER bound on the true dead-field count, and is trusted for that and
 *  not for more — a prior ratchet here (exported_symbols) once reported 60 orphans where the truth
 *  was 19 because it could not see `export *`, which is why the blind spots below travel WITH the
 *  analysis as `methodNote` rather than living only in a strippable source comment.
 *
 *  METHOD NOTE MARKERS. `methodNote` is a first-class, testable string on the returned report. It
 *  names the fail-safe policy and every blind spot, and deliberately contains the literal markers the
 *  law greps for: `Object.keys`, `spread`, `dynamic`, `READ`, and `src/`.
 *
 *  HAND-VERIFICATION OF THE CALIBRATION SET (recorded below in CALIBRATION_TRAIL; done by inspection
 *  over the corpus at build time, 2026-08-20):
 *    · `tests_added` (domain_types/change-set.json, absent from required_fields) — zero `\btests_added\b`
 *      reads in src/*.ts. MUST be reported unread. → present in `unread`.
 *    · `repository`  (change-request.json / change-context.json) — read at src/worker.ts. → NOT unread.
 *    · `supplies`    (genome_schema.ts ChairSchema) — read for its value at src/runtime.ts and as keys
 *      at src/composition.ts (`Object.keys(ch.supplies ?? {})`; counted READ). → NOT unread.
 *    · `hydration`   (genome_schema.ts SkillSchema) — read at src/claude_invoker.ts / src/runtime.ts.
 *      → NOT unread.
 *  If the engine ever flags one of the three negative-calibration names, the ENGINE is wrong and must
 *  be fixed — the sealed calibration assertions are the contract and are not to be relaxed. */

// halves. `description` already had four readers in src/server.ts on main, so it was never in the

// ("under typed invariants") contains the word, and stripComments below blanks comments but NOT
// string literals. Prose retired a real finding, and the ratchet reported it as progress.
//
// That is precisely the defect this file already documents one layer up: "A COMMENT IS NOT A

// moves the true count 217 → 242: twenty-five declared fields currently read as reached ONLY
// because their name appears inside some string in src/. Re-baselining a sealed ratchet by
// twenty-five belongs in its own change, with its own reading of what those fields are — not

/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * TWO CORPORA — engine (src/) vs contract (broad).
 *
 * The single sweep above unions THREE namespaces and searches ONE corpus (flat src/*.ts). Those three
 * namespaces do not share a reader obligation, so the sweep is split into TWO populations, each with its
 * OWN corpus and its OWN ratchet pin:
 *
 *   · ENGINE fields  — the Zod object keys of src/genome_schema.ts. src/ IS the right corpus: orchestrator
 *     code is meant to read them. Searched in the SAME flat top-level src/*.ts corpus as the single sweep
 *     (srcCorpus()). Because genome_schema.ts is itself a top-level src/*.ts file, every extracted Zod key
 *     necessarily matches \bname\b at its own declaration line, so — under the preserved fail-safe rule
 *     (ANY word-boundary hit is READ) — NO engine field is ever reported unread. The engine ratchet floor
 *     is therefore 0, and the sealed engine-soundness law (which re-derives the SAME flat srcCorpus()) is
 *     exactly what forces it: any engine-unread name would be found in genome_schema.ts and flagged a false
 *     positive. A future genome field can only enter engine.unread if it appears NOWHERE in src/ including
 *     its own declaration file — which the extractor cannot produce — so this population guards the shape
 *     of the sweep rather than accumulating a backlog.
 *
 *   · CONTRACT fields — the schema.properties keys of domain_types/*.json + core_types/*.json. These are
 *     agent-to-agent PAYLOAD: one agent fills them, another reads them, and src/ never names them BY
 *     DESIGN. Their reader corpus is the BROAD tree — agents/ + standards/ + evals/ + src/, read
 *     RECURSIVELY (agents' phase_agents/, players/, seeds/; src/judges/) — so a field named by an agent
 *     method, a standard, an eval, or orchestrator code counts as READ. A contract field with no reader
 *     ANYWHERE in that tree is the genuine dead-payload class this ratchet holds.
 *
 * Both analyzers preserve every method invariant of the single sweep unchanged: the fail-safe posture
 * (AMBIGUOUS IS READ → each pin is a LOWER bound), the Object.keys-counts-as-READ rule (natural under
 * word-boundary matching, exercised by `supplies`), MIN_NAME_LENGTH = 5 with its stated consequence, and a
 * first-class METHOD_NOTE carried on each report (every marker the law greps for: Object.keys, spread,
 * dynamic, READ, src/). They reuse the SAME extractors (declaredFieldsFromGenomeSchema,
 * declaredFieldsFromJsonDir) and the SAME srcCorpus() as the single sweep, so the original population's
 * behaviour and its 181 pin are untouched.

/** ENGINE ratchet FLOOR (hand-verified 2026-08-21). It is 0 and cannot grow under this method: an engine
 *  field only becomes unread if it appears NOWHERE in flat src/*.ts, but genome_schema.ts — a src/*.ts file
 *  — always holds its declaration, so \bname\b always matches. The pin exists to hold the shape of the
 *  sweep (separate engine population, its own floor) and to fail LOUDLY if the engine corpus is ever
 *  narrowed to exclude genome_schema.ts and a genuine orchestrator-dead field surfaces. May only decrease. */
/**
 * VERIFIED, not assumed. 14 Zod fields in genome_schema.ts have no reader anywhere else in src/:
 *
 *   technique_evidence · contract_caps · witnessed_by · auth_user_id · parent_org · is_institution
 *   from_institution · to_institution · from_node · to_node · edge_type · ordinal · wiki_space
 *   what_taken
 *
 * Almost all of them are the institutions / lineage surface — loaded into the genome and never
 * consumed by name. `technique_evidence` is the one CLAUDE.md calls "what makes 'why this player in
 * this chair' a record rather than a recollection", and nothing reads it.
 *
 * WHAT 14 MEANS — AND IT IS NOT 14 BUGS. Twelve of the fourteen are the institutions / lineage
 * surface, and that surface is load-only BY DESIGN and documented as such: CLAUDE.md describes the
 * `institutions` class as "file-shaped under institutions/, loaded by loadInstitutions … and returned
 * in the genome alongside every other class", with "No MCP authoring surface yet". Verified rather
 * than assumed: `assignments` and `lineage_edges` are read ONLY inside src/institution_loader.ts,
 * their own loader, and neither server.ts, runtime.ts, composition.ts nor worker.ts consumes the
 * loaded institutions map at all.
 *
 * So this pin is a measure of an UNFINISHED FEATURE, not of rot — the class is honestly labelled
 * incomplete, and these fields are waiting for the consumer that has not been built. The number is
 * still worth pinning: if it GROWS, something new was declared with no reader, and that is a
 * defect. If the institutions consumer ever lands, it should SHRINK, and lowering the pin is how
 * that gets recorded.
 *
 * The two that are not lineage — `contract_caps` and `technique_evidence` — sit on chair assignments
 * and are the ones worth a second look, because CLAUDE.md describes technique_evidence as "what
 * makes 'why this player in this chair' a record rather than a recollection". Nothing reads it, so
 * for now it is exactly the recollection it was meant to replace.
 *
 * This pin sat at 0 and could not move: srcCorpus() included genome_schema.ts itself, so every field
 * matched its own declaration and counted as READ. Injecting `a_field_nothing_reads: z.string()` left
 * all 18 laws green. A declaration is not a read; the corpus now excludes the declaring file.

// 14 → 22 when comments stopped counting as readers. The eight that surfaced — address, asserts,
// corpus, max_bytes, max_requests, methods, quote, statement — each verified BY HAND to have zero
// non-comment references outside genome_schema.ts. They were never read; they were only written
// about.
// 22 → 21: `contract_caps` gained its first reader when the placement resolver began enforcing the
// narrowing rule. The pin SHRINKING is the direction that matters — a field stopped being declared-
// and-unread because something started using it, which is the whole point of measuring this.
// 21 → 23: BearingLawSchema landed (the loader learned the bearing-law kind) and declared
// `instrument` + `subject_ref` — hand-verified: zero non-comment `\binstrument\b` / `\bsubject_ref\b`
// reads in src/*.ts outside genome_schema.ts. Same posture as the institutions-class fields above:
// an UNFINISHED FEATURE, not rot. A bearing-law is canon the engine validates and CARRIES — its
// consumer is Nomos's seal and a future bearing-law browse surface, neither built yet. `bearer`,
// `provenance`, `source` etc. from the same schema matched existing src readers, so only these two
// surface. When a bearing-law consumer lands, this should SHRINK back.

/** CONTRACT ratchet FLOOR (hand-verified 2026-08-21). 127 = the count of domain_types/*.json +
 *  core_types/*.json schema.properties keys (>= 5 chars, deduped) with no `\bname\b` reader anywhere in the
 *  broad corpus agents/ + standards/ + evals/ + src/. Verified by independent word-boundary grep over the
 *  live tree (per TWO_CORPORA_CALIBRATION_TRAIL): every one of the 127 is genuinely unread across all four

/**
 * READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING THIS NUMBER. It is NOT a defect count, and it is much weaker evidence
 * than the ENGINE pin above.
 *
 * A contract field does not need a textual reader to be used. An agent fills a domain-type field
 * because the SCHEMA is handed to it — through the chair's output_contract and the seal predicate —
 * not because prose in agents/, standards/ or evals/ names the field. So "no word-boundary mention
 * anywhere" is normal for a schema-driven field and says almost nothing about whether it is alive.
 *
 * MEASURED, and it is decisive. Of change-verdict's 6 declared fields this sweep reports 5 as unread:
 * criteria_unmet, decision_ref, failures_verbatim, inferred_not_run, scope_drift. Every one of them
 * was FILLED by the change-verifier in gig d048e2fa. The sweep is not detecting dead fields there; it
 * is detecting that no one writes their names in prose.
 *
 * The same correction applies to this module's own calibration case. `tests_added` is reported unread
 * and that is TRUE of the text — but it is populated in 86 of 97 sealed change-set outputs on disk.
 * It is FILLED AND UNCONSUMED (no code, eval or standard acts on it), which is a real but much
 * smaller defect than "a field nobody reads".
 *
 * So: treat a GROWING number as worth a look and nothing more, and never read the absolute value as
 * a count of defects. The honest test for a contract field is whether any SEALED OUTPUT ever carries
 * it — runtime evidence this static sweep cannot see. That check is worth building; this one is not
 * a substitute for it.
