// RED-first — Item 2, the GIG-LEVEL OVERFLOW POOL: a per-gig quantity of reserve turns that a
// budget-exhausted chair draws from, with two governor constraints made into algebra rather than
// prose — a chair may NEVER draw more than its OWN declared turn_reserve even when the pool is
// larger (theft is impossible), and the pool CAN empty so a later chair finds nothing (starvation is
// reachable and must be VISIBLE, never silent).
//
// The pool lives on the dispatch deps (RunDeps.turn_pool — the primary source, O6/I9; migrated off
// the retired RunDeps.budget.pool) with an optional standard-level default (Standard.reserve_pool);
// the dispatch value overrides the default (F5). The runtime
// caps each seated chair's offered reserve to `min(chair.turn_reserve, pool_remaining)` and threads
// THAT as ctx.turn_reserve into the invoker (the existing reserve-grant machinery consumes it). When
// the invoker actually grants (its budget_reserve_granted event fires), the runtime decrements the
// pool and appends an attributable draw record to the gig's budget snapshot. None of this exists
// yet: today ctx.turn_reserve is never set from a pool, no pool is tracked, and no draw is recorded —
// so every assertion below fails on BEHAVIOUR (an absent value / an un-decremented pool), not on a
// missing symbol.
//
// Covers contract INV8, INV9, INV10, INV11, INV12, INV13, INV18, INV19 and F2, F3, F5, F6, F7.
// The conservation laws (INV8-INV12) are pinned as fast-check properties over generated pools and
// chair-reserve vectors — the governor's two constraints are laws that must hold for EVERY ordering,
// not a hand-picked example the contract could satisfy by luck.
