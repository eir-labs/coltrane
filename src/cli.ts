/**
 * The coltrane command line.
 *
 * Until now the package shipped exactly one executable — the MCP stdio server. That makes the
 * engine reachable from an MCP client and from nothing else: not CI, not cron, not a container,
 * not a queue worker, not a shell. A methodology engine whose only caller is an interactive
 * client cannot be part of a build.
 *
 * This is a thin wrapper, deliberately. `dispatchTool(slug, args, deps)` is already the entire
 * tool surface as a pure function, and `bootstrapServerDeps` already resolves the genome root,
 * the durable ledger and the output store. The MCP server is one wrapper over that pair; this
 * is a second. Almost nothing here is new behaviour, which is the point — two front doors that
 * disagreed about what a dispatch means would be the same defect this engine spent a release
 * removing.
 *
 * Conventions, chosen so this composes with other programs:
 *   - DATA goes to stdout, everything else to stderr. `coltrane dispatch … --json | jq` works.
 *   - Exit 0 success, 1 the command ran and failed, 2 the command was malformed. `validate`
 *     exits non-zero when the genome has load errors, which is what makes it a CI gate. A
 *     dispatch that PARKS at a human chair exits 0: waiting on a person is the standard
 *     working as written, and a job that read it as failure would retry a run that needs a
 *     signature rather than a fix.
 *   - `--json` prints the tool's `data` verbatim; without it, a short human summary.

A dispatch that reaches a chair a HUMAN holds parks: it names the waiting chair and exits 0,
because a gig waiting on a person is not a failed gig. Approve it on the resume —

  coltrane dispatch <standard> --resume <gig> \\
      --approve approve=@verdict.json --as eugene

--input is NOT required on an approve-only resume: when every remaining chair is human the
checkpoint's recorded payload stands and the omission inherits it. If you DO pass --input it is
checked against the checkpoint, and a disagreement still refuses the resume.
