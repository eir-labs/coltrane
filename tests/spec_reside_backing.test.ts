// RED — the BACKING SEAM: reside is platform-agnostic at the engine level, and local / hand-built /
// hosted are three doors selected by environment PRESENCE, never guessed between.
//
// This is selectQueueBacking's shape, one table over, and deliberately so (src/local_queue.ts:153):
// it reads the VALUE of no credential, it answers from presence alone, and when two backings are
// configured it REFUSES rather than picking a precedence order — which store owns a seat is not a
// thing to guess. The one addition is a third door: a module you wrote yourself.
//
// THE LOAD-BEARING LAW HERE IS THE AGNOSTICISM ONE. The engine ships the port, the selector, the
// local provider and the refusals — and NO eir-specific code. `hosted` resolves to a backing the
// DEPLOYMENT injects, the way deps.queueGig and deps.mintVenueCredential already work. If coltrane
// ever grows a residency.claim() call of its own, the last law in this file goes red.

 * The reside path — the files this law holds to the agnosticism standard.
 *
 * DISCOVERED, NEVER LISTED, and that is the whole point. This used to be the literal
 * `["reside.ts", "reside_backing.ts"]`, which made the law unable to see the one file anybody would
 * actually add: a `reside_hosted.ts` wiring eir's residency RPCs straight into the engine would
 * have passed this suite untouched — not because it was clean, but because the list was short. A
 * rule that cannot fail is remembered, not enforced, and a two-name array is a memory.
 *
 * So the corpus is every `reside*.ts` / `residency*.ts` in src/. Add a file to the reside path and
 * it is in scope by existing, which is what makes "the engine ships no platform of its own" a
 * property rather than a promise. `src/worker.ts` stays deliberately OUT: it names
 * coltrane_drain_claim directly, and this law pins what reside is rather than re-litigating the
 * drain — reside.ts re-exports workOnce, so a naive import closure would drag it in and red on
 * history instead of on drift.
