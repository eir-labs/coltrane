// RED-first — issue #227, second half: "7 registered domain types declare
// `required_fields: []` … so an empty `{}` validates and seals as a well-formed empty
// output."
//
// The issue is CORRECT on the symptom and UNDERSTATES the cause. It frames the empty
// `required_fields` as possibly-deliberate sparseness for draft/scratch types. It is not.
// All 7 of those types DO declare their required fields — in the JSON Schema idiom, inside
// `schema.required` — and `src/registry.ts:161` throws that away:
//
//     const schema = {
//       type: "object",
//       properties: { ...baseProps, ...ownProps },
//       required: dt.required_fields,        // ← the type's own schema.required is DISCARDED
//       additionalProperties,
//     };
//
// Independently derived against main @ 929f81c (all 30 domain_types/*.json read):
//
//   slug                  schema.required (declared, dropped)
//   ────────────────────  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//   draft-agent-profile   input_refs, slug, description, behavioral_primitives,
//                         system_prompt_draft, user_acceptance
//   draft-domain-type     input_refs, slug, extends, domain, schema, user_acceptance
//   draft-standard        input_refs, slug, domain, phases, user_acceptance
//   pattern-extraction    input_refs, user_signature, confidence_band
//   project-charter       id, name, use_case, scope
//   repo-survey           repo_path, repo_name, survey_completeness
//   seeding-verdict       input_refs, repos_surveyed, pass, checks, outcome
//
// ZERO domain types in the genome are genuinely sparse: every type with
// `required_fields: []` has a non-empty `schema.required`. So the "maybe the author meant
// it" reading has no instances to defend. This is an authoring-convention split — the 23
// patent/e2e types populate `required_fields` and leave `schema.required` empty; these 7
// (all domain `seeding` / `bootstrap`) do the reverse — and the loader never reconciles the
// two. `src/server.ts:609` shows the intended direction of normalization:
//
//     const nextRequired = extension?.schema?.required ?? baseDef.required_fields;
//
// i.e. `type_extend` ALREADY treats `schema.required` as the authoritative source and
// projects it into `required_fields`. These 7 types were hand-authored as files, so that
// normalization never ran on them.
//
// Contract pinned here: a domain type's declared required fields are enforced at seal,
// whichever of the two fields the author used to declare them.
