// RED SPEC — lineage-record-typing-v1 (migration): tightening a SHIPPED type must not make
// sealed history unreadable or retroactively invalid. The genome holds 10 sealed lineage-records
// and 2 sealed lineage-verdicts; outputs carry domain_type_version. Records sealed under version 1
// are historical fact — they must remain readable and traceable; they simply were not held to the
// new bar.
//
// This is nearly free because validation is WRITE-TIME ONLY: checkWritable runs inside write()
// (src/outputs.ts:634-639); the read path hydrateGig (src/outputs.ts:593-607) reads rows straight
// into the map with NO re-validation, and domain_type_version is folded into content_sha
// (src/outputs.ts:653) so old hashes are untouched by the bump. So a v1 record — loose, prose-
// grounded, and INVALID under v2 — must still hydrate, trace, and report domain_type_version:1.
//
// RED trigger: the invariant references the v2 bump, and the type is still version 1 on disk, so
// `version === 2` fails until domain_types/lineage-record.json is bumped. The readability half is
// the golden-master: the historical BYTES are the oracle, exercised through the exact read path
// that guarantees they survive.
//
// CAVEAT (honest): the 10 real sealed records live in the organization's genome STORE, not in this
// public repo tree, so they are not reachable from a worktree checkout. The fixtures below
// faithfully reproduce the two records the brief names — 03cacf6a (nine connections, one grounded
// "fully", eight "conceptual") and c2000367 (grounded:None on all nine) — as raw historical bytes.
// They are deliberately in the LOOSE v1 shape that v2 would reject, so a read path that re-validated
// would break on them; that is precisely the property under test. When run against the real store
// (COLTRANE_LINEAGE_STORE pointing at the org outputs dir), swap the fixture for the real bytes.
