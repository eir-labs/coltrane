/**
 * Permission tier → Node --permission flags, SCOPED TO THE SKILL.
 *
 * This used to be `--allow-fs-read=*` for every tier, with a comment asserting that tier 0
 * "cannot write, spawn, or reach the network". Probed through `executeSkill` on a real
 * machine, a tier-0 skill read `/etc/passwd`, read all 77 of the parent's environment
 * variables, and completed an outbound HTTPS request. `--allow-fs-read=*` is literally
 * "read every file", so the first was never confined at all.
 *
 * The reads are now scoped to the skill's own package directory plus the runner that has to
 * import it. `tests/skill_sandbox_confinement.test.ts` probes the capability rather than the
 * flag string, because asserting on flags is how the previous claim survived being false.
 *
 * THE NETWORK. The previous comment here said Node's permission model has no network gate and
 * that an outbound request from a skill was possible and stated rather than denied. That stopped
 * being true: under `--permission` the network is now DENIED unless `--allow-net` is passed, so a
 * skill's `fetch` fails with ERR_ACCESS_DENIED before it reaches a host. Measured, not assumed —
 * every URL in a landscape run came back `error: TypeError` until the flag was passed.
 *
 * So the grant that was already in the schema and read by nothing — `SkillPermissionSchema.network`
 * (NetworkGrantSchema: allow[], methods?, max_requests?, max_bytes?) — is now what decides: no
 * grant, no flag, no network. It is a DECLARED capability rather than a tier, because a tier-0
 * fetcher (`patent-fetch`) needs it while a tier-2 skill that only runs tests must not get it for
 * free. `patent-fetch`'s "if the cage blocks the network" fallback was describing this gate
 * without knowing it existed.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO: `--allow-net` is all-or-nothing — Node has no per-host form. The grant's
 * `allow` list is therefore enforced INSIDE the child by `skill_runner.mjs`, which wraps `fetch`
 * and refuses a host the grant does not name. That bounds the skill's own code; it is not a proof
 * against code that deliberately reaches around it (`node:net` is reachable once the capability is
 * granted). Granting network to a skill grants it the network; the allowlist keeps an honest skill
 * honest and makes a dishonest one visible in review. The credential remains out of reach either
 * way: the child gets an explicit minimal environment (see `skillEnv`).
