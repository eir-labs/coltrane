# Spec: refuse an unenforceable `permission.network` at load time

**Status:** SUPERSEDED 2026-09-20 — the premise changed. See "What changed" below.
**Change request:** close the false-assurance gap where a skill declares a network
permission that nothing reads, enforces, or refuses.
**Decision:** REFUSE fail-closed at load time (miles-change-decision-c63b88b1).

## The defect, measured

`src/genome_schema.ts:36-45` declares:

```ts
export const NetworkGrantSchema = z.object({
  allow: z.array(z.string()).default([]),
  methods: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
  max_requests: z.number().optional(),
  max_bytes: z.number().optional(),
});
export const SkillPermissionSchema = z.object({
  tier: z.number().optional(),
  network: NetworkGrantSchema.optional(),
});
```

`SkillSchema.permission` (`src/genome_schema.ts:77`) carries it. A well-formed
`permission.network` passes `SkillSchema.safeParse` at `src/loader.ts:438` and is
stored in the `SkillRecord` at `src/loader.ts:449`. **No code path outside
`genome_schema.ts` reads `permission.network`, `max_requests`, `max_bytes` or
`methods`** — verified by grep over `src/`. A skill declaring `max_requests: 100`
gets no request limit; `methods: ["GET"]` may issue any verb; `allow: [...]`
constrains no origin. This is a *false assurance*, worse than a missing feature.

## Which network chokepoints exist in the execution path (AC5, stated plainly)

**None.** The skill execution path is `src/skill_subprocess.ts` →
`src/skill_runner.mjs` under Node's `--permission` sandbox:

- `src/skill_subprocess.ts:177,185` and `:239,247` read only `meta.permission?.tier`
  and emit only `tierFlags(tier, dir)` — filesystem/child-process tier flags. No
  network flag is ever emitted.
- Node's `--permission` model has **no `--allow-net` flag** — it governs the
  filesystem and child processes, not the network.
- `src/skill_runner.mjs:12-15` states it outright: *"It CAN still reach the
  network: Node's permission model has no network gate … A real network gate needs
  a runtime that has one."*

So ENFORCE is impossible without infrastructure that does not exist (a proxy/
interceptor), which is out of scope. The honest answer is REFUSE.

## The rule this repo already applies to the identical defect

`src/tool_providers.ts:169-185`, `assertToolGrantsResolvable`: a granted tool with
no resolvable provider is a *dead name* and dispatch **throws** naming the agent and
the grant — it is not warned or logged. A network grant the runtime cannot back is
the same defect one layer over, and gets the same treatment: refusal with a named
error.

## Obligations → mechanism → callsite → verifying law

| # | Obligation (invariant) | Mechanism / callsite | Verifying law |
|---|---|---|---|
| INV-REFUSE-LOAD | A skill whose parsed `permission.network` is present and non-null is refused at **load** time — `loadGenome` throws, fail-closed, before the `SkillRecord` is stored. | After `SkillSchema.safeParse` succeeds at `src/loader.ts:438-442` and before `skills.set(...)` at `:449`, inspect `metaCheck.data.permission?.network`; if present, `throw new SkillLoadError(...)`. | `RED: refuses at load a skill declaring a well-formed permission.network` |
| INV-ERROR-NAMES-SLUG-AND-FIELD | The thrown message names the skill **slug** and the field **`permission.network`**, in the shape of `assertToolGrantsResolvable` (`tool_providers.ts:180-183`) — not a warning, not a log line. | Same throw; message includes `pkg.meta.slug` and the literal `permission.network`, with the dead-name framing. | `RED: the refusal names the skill slug and the field 'permission.network'` |
| INV-REFUSE-ANY-NONNULL | Refusal triggers on **any** non-null network, including an empty `{}` (which `NetworkGrantSchema` parses to `{ allow: [] }`) — presence, not content, is the trigger. | The check is `permission?.network !== undefined` on the *parsed* object, not a per-field inspection. | `RED: any non-null network is refused — even an empty {} object` |
| INV-BASELINE-TIER-ONLY | A skill declaring `permission.tier` but no `network` loads unchanged and preserves `tier`. | The gate does nothing when `permission?.network` is absent; the existing `skills.set` path at `:449` is untouched. | `GREEN control: a skill declaring no network (permission.tier only) loads and preserves its tier` |
| INV-BASELINE-NO-PERMISSION | A skill declaring no `permission` at all loads unchanged. | Same — `permission?.network` is `undefined`, gate is inert. | `GREEN control: a skill declaring NO permission at all loads unchanged` |

`NetworkGrantSchema` / `SkillPermissionSchema` remain in `genome_schema.ts`
untouched; the spawn path (`skill_subprocess.ts`) is untouched. Only *loading* a
skill that declares `permission.network` is refused.

## Test method

Example-based laws over the real load gate (`loadGenome`, `src/loader.ts`), in
`tests/skill_package_loading.test.ts`. The refusal laws are RED — the loader stores
the record and throws nothing today; they flip GREEN when the gate lands. The two
baseline laws are GREEN controls proving the change does not narrow a skill that
declares no network permission.

## Rollback

Revert the `src/loader.ts` gate and the five added laws in a single commit. Nothing
downstream ever read `permission.network`, so restoring load-accepts-network is
complete and side-effect-free; `NetworkGrantSchema` was never modified.

## What changed (2026-09-20)

This spec's decision — refuse ANY declared `permission.network` at load — rested on a
measured fact: no code path read the grant, and Node's `--permission` model had no
network flag, so the runtime *could not* back it. Both halves of that have moved.

**Node 24 added `--allow-net`.** Under `--permission` the network is now denied unless
that flag is passed. Measured on this machine (Node 26.7.0): a tier-0 skill's `fetch`
fails with `ERR_ACCESS_DENIED`, and every one of 101 URLs in a landscape discovery run
came back `error: TypeError` until the flag was granted. `patent-fetch`'s "if the cage
blocks the network" fallback had been describing this gate without knowing it existed.

**The chokepoint now exists, and reads the grant:**

- `src/skill_subprocess.ts` passes `--allow-net` **only** when `meta.permission.network`
  is declared, and passes the grant to the child in the input envelope. No grant, no
  flag, and the capability is denied at the syscall — the declaration is what decides.
- `src/skill_runner.mjs` wraps `fetch` and enforces the rest of the grant, because
  `--allow-net` is all-or-nothing: `allow[]` (host equality or subdomain; `*` for any),
  `methods[]`, `max_requests`, and `max_bytes` (the body readers are wrapped, so an
  oversized response throws rather than being returned).

**So the law narrows rather than disappears.** What is refused at load is a grant *this
runtime cannot back* — Node older than 24, where `--permission` has no network gate at
all and the declaration would again promise what nothing enforces. The false-assurance
principle is unchanged; the set of unenforceable cases shrank to one.

**And the refusal is TOTAL, not fatal.** The unbackable skill drops out with a named
`load_error` and the rest of the genome loads, exactly as `loadInstitutions` treats a
malformed institution. The first version threw, and CI (Node 22) showed what that costs:
one fetching skill made the whole genome unloadable and took four unrelated suites with
it. "This one skill cannot run on this runtime" must not become "nothing loads on this
runtime". Nothing can seat a skill that was never admitted, so a chair naming it fails
closed at compose with a reason.

**What is still not claimed.** The wrapper bounds the skill's own code. Once the
capability is granted, code that deliberately reaches around it (`node:net`, a fresh
undici agent) is not stopped by it, and `max_bytes` bounds what a body reader hands back
rather than what crossed the wire. Granting network to a skill grants it the network;
the allowlist keeps an honest skill honest and makes a dishonest one visible in review.
