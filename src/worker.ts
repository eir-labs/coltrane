// worker.ts — the drain worker's verb set. The gig table IS the queue; this module is the
// consumer that turns a queued row into a completed one.
//
// The credential model is two keys with two jobs (governor rulings, 2026-08-10):
//   * a ctk_ AGENT token — per-agent, authenticates WHO is working. Claim, genome read, and
//     failure reporting all speak through it; authorization derives from the CHAIR CONTRACT
//     the agent is seated on (the store enforces it — "standards should be authorized on
//     chair contract"). A token narrows the office, never widens it.
//   * a cdk_ DRAIN key — per-ORGANIZATION, because the org is the resource boundary. It is
//     the write path for results (outputs + gig header), consumed by the engine's drain
//     layer via COLTRANE_DRAIN_URL / COLTRANE_DRAIN_KEY, not by this module directly.
//
// workOnce runs the claimed gig UNDER THE CLAIMED GIG'S ID (deps.gig_id), so the drained
// header completes the queue row itself — one record per gig, no parallel bookkeeping. A
// run that throws is recorded as failed through coltrane_mcp_gig_fail; a worker crash
// leaves only an expiring lease, which the claim RPC hands to the next worker.
//
// The third outcome is the HUMAN SEAT. A run that reaches a chair a person holds parks:
// coltrane_mcp_gig_park sets the row to awaiting_approval and clears the lease, so the store's
// approve RPC can re-queue it at once. The approval comes back on the next claim payload, and
// the durable checkpoint (workerStateRoot) means the approved re-claim RESTORES the chairs that
// already sealed instead of paying for them twice.
//
// THAT LOCAL CHECKPOINT IS ONLY THE FAST PATH. A human-in-the-loop delay is measured in hours
// or days, and the worker that re-claims is a different process — often on a different machine
// — from the one that parked. `workerStateRoot()` cannot travel, so on its own it makes the
// saving conditional on the accident of which box picked the row up.
//
// The SINK already is the checkpoint. Every sealed output drained to the org store carries its
// content_sha, its input_shas, its phase, its agent_slug and its whole `data`; the drained gig
// header carries the run's genome_hash. So a worker with no local record reconstructs one from
// the sink (`resumeStateFromDrain` below) and resumes from that. Resume state's home is the
// store; the local checkpoint demotes to a fast path.

 *    sibling `outputs/<gig>.jsonl` and `refs/<gig>.jsonl` — they are dead weight once the

 *    TTL. This is the other half of the leak: success removes the checkpoint but leaves the rows.
 *
 * WHAT IT NEVER TOUCHES:
 *  - Any gig whose checkpoint is FRESHER than the TTL. A parked / awaiting-approval gig's
 *    checkpoint is LOAD-BEARING for the approved resume, and the TTL is the "reasonable window"
 *    that protects it — the reaper cannot see the org store's row status locally, so mtime is
 *    the proxy: recent state is kept. A fresh checkpoint's outputs are never swept even if the
 *    outputs file itself looks old (a restore-only resume re-touches the checkpoint but appends
 *    no new rows), because the sweep is driven from checkpoint age, not output age.
 *
 * Best-effort by construction: every filesystem op is caught and recorded in `errors`; the
