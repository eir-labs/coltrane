# CLAUDE.md

You are running in a **coltrane-oss** workspace. This file is loaded automatically at
session start and tells you how to operate against this codebase's mechanics.

Read it once; the rules apply for the rest of the session.

**This file is for you — the computer reader.** `README.md` is for the humans you play
with; if a person points you at the README, read it, then come back here. Both are
**cold-start files**: read them at the top of the session, and update them as you onboard —
they are meant to grow under you, not sit frozen.

---

## First contact — calibrate the instrument (fresh clone, exactly once)

If `.coltrane/tuned.json` does NOT exist yet, you are talking to someone who just cloned
coltrane and said hi. **Do NOT assume a project is already in flight** — nothing has been
calibrated to this player yet, and that is the first move. There is an instrument in the
room; tune it to them before any real work starts.

**Step 1 — greet, then offer two ways in.** Don't railroad; let them pick.

Say plainly: "Welcome to Coltrane. There's an instrument here and it isn't calibrated to
you yet. Two ways to start —

1. **See what it does — and how you author with it.** A short live tour, all through the
   MCP surface (you never copy-paste a definition into a file — the tools do the writing):
   dispatch the `summarize` standard end-to-end and trace its sealed outputs; run the tamper
   test (`agent_evolve` an agent → watch `genome_hash` move; try a breaking change → watch
   the cascade fail closed); then the authoring loop — `agent_define` a fresh agent, bind a
   skill into it and run it, `standard_compose` a two-phase standard. You build agents and
   standards by *talking to me*; the genome is the source of truth, not a pasted snippet.
2. **Tune it to your work.** The deepest signal isn't your repos — it's your **active Claude
   Code session transcripts** under `~/.claude/projects/`. With permission I'll walk them
   (plus a few adjacent repos), cluster what you actually do across threads, and distill the
   recurrent roles / workflows / data-shapes into draft agents/standards/types for you to
   accept or reject. Which way?"

For (2): the repo survey is **`seed-from-local-repos-v0`**. The chat-log synthesis — reading
`~/.claude/projects/*.jsonl` and clustering by author / lane / repo — is **`synthesis-walk-v0`**
(`source-walker → event-clusterer → synthesis-writer`). Conduct whichever is present
(conductor mode: this thread walks the phases, never a hand-rolled scan); the chat-log walk
is the real magic, so lead with it when it's available. Steps 2–5 below are the repo-survey
mechanism. Either way, end by writing `.coltrane/tuned.json` (Step 5) and appending what
you learned to this file (Step 4).

**Step 2 — ask permission to scan adjacent repos.** (The "tune it to your work" branch.)

Say: "Can I scan a few of your other repos to learn the domain and your style? I'll
only do a survey-level read (file names, README first paragraph, recent commit
themes, language). I will NOT exfiltrate code or read secrets. Name any 2-5 repo
paths you want me to look at, or say 'skip' to skip this step."

If they name paths: scan each one with the Read tool (READMEs, top-level file
structure, last 30 days of `git log --oneline` if a git repo). Do not deeply read
source files. Do not touch `.env`, `secrets/`, or anything under `.git/`.

If they say skip: continue without the scan.

**Step 3 — propose changes to the book. Grow in place, not replace.**

First, read every existing file under `agents/`, `standards/`, `skills/`, `core_types/`,
`domain_types/`. Then based on Step 1 + Step 2, propose CHANGES:

- **edits** to existing agents whose shape now fits the user's domain better
- **new** agents for domain-specific work that no existing agent covers
- **new** standards if multi-phase workflows you found in their repos suggest one

For example:
- a research scientist might get an EDIT to `code-reviewer` (`tools` narrowed,
  scope re-pointed at LaTeX/Jupyter) plus NEW `literature-scout` + `claim-bounder`
- a backend engineer might get an EDIT to `code-reviewer` (scope re-pointed
  at their language) plus NEW `migration-planner` + `incident-responder`

For each proposal, show: the file path, whether it's an edit or new, and a one-line
scope description. Ask which they want applied. Apply only the ones they say yes to.

Never silently overwrite. The set grows; it does not get replaced.

**Step 4 — propose edits to THIS CLAUDE.md.**

Do NOT write a separate workspace CLAUDE.md. Coltrane already ships one (the file
you are reading now). Instead, propose appendable edits to this file:

- a "What this workspace works on" section reflecting the user's Step 1 answer
- an "Agents added this tuning" list with the agents they accepted in Step 3
- a "Conventions inferred from adjacent repos" section if Step 2 found patterns
  (language, formatting, naming, branch conventions)

Show the proposed appended block. Ask if they want it added. Append on yes.
Never replace the existing protocol sections — append below them.

**Step 5 — seal the moment.**

Create `.coltrane/tuned.json` with:

```json
{
  "tuned_at": "<ISO-8601 timestamp>",
  "user_summary": "<their step-1 answer, verbatim>",
  "scanned_repos": ["<path>", "..."],
  "agents_created": ["<name>", "..."],
  "claude_md_appended": true | false,
  "agents_edited": ["<name>", "..."]
}
```

This file is the seal — the project's first sealed claim about what it is. Future
sessions read `.coltrane/tuned.json` to know tuning has already happened and skip
to normal work.

**If `.coltrane/tuned.json` already exists**: skip the discovery, read its
`user_summary`, and proceed normally.

## North Stars — what to reach for (seeded for the next Claude)

Not rules. Directions to look when you have slack. Coltrane rewards a Claude who pauses up
top instead of diving straight in — these are where the magic tends to hide:

- **Model the domain before the work.** The highest-leverage move is defining the *type
  space* of a domain first — dispatch a research / double-diamond standard and let the data
  model explore more dimensions than the obvious framing. Solidity downstream is bought up top.
- **Spend orientation, not improvisation, on coordination.** A band that runs on shared
  theory improvises with all its headspace. Seat the agent with a score; don't make it figure
  out its life at runtime. The orientation you set before the downbeat matters more than the
  cleverness mid-phase.
- **Treat inference as scarce.** Encode what repeats; decode only what's live. When a step
  could be cached, reduced, or skipped, notice it and say so — that instinct is a feature.
- **Leave conclusions honestly open.** When you assert something you can't ground in
  deterministic signal, mark it open, go find a real source, bring it back, and log the
  attribution. An unverifiable claim is a door, not a wall.
- **Suspect the last inch, not the code.** This engine's mechanisms are mostly right; what fails is
  the join between a mechanism and its caller. A field declared and never read. A safety mechanism
  with eleven passing laws and zero standards setting it. A collector nothing calls. A class the
  package does not ship. Every one of those passed CI, because a test proves a mechanism WORKS and
  nothing was asking whether it is REACHED. When you finish something, ask what would fail if it
  were silently disconnected — and if the answer is *nothing*, you have not finished.

- **An absence is not an error, and that is what makes it dangerous.** The costly defects do not
  raise; they return a legitimate-looking value. A drain that SUCCEEDS quietly writes to production.
  A default standing in for a real value leaves nothing to grep for. An empty class is
  indistinguishable from "none were declared". A sealed row can name a version nothing ever wrote.
  Prefer a loud refusal to a plausible default: this repo already refuses a tool grant with no
  provider, a skill permission it cannot enforce, and a boundary check whose term list is missing.
  Absent must mean DECLINE, never quietly stand in.

- **A rule that cannot fail is remembered, not enforced.** Prose in a brief loses to a tool grant
  every time — measured: a laws-first ordering demanded in capitals across three dispatches was
  ignored, and the same ordering held on the first run once the drafter's grant could not reach
  `src/` and the builder's input contract required a sealed red-spec. When you find yourself writing
  a longer instruction, look for the structure that makes the instruction unnecessary. And check the
  claims a document makes about ITSELF: behaviour claims stay true because a test breaks when they
  drift; status and inventory claims rot silently, so delete them or make them checkable.

- **A green check is a claim. Ask whether it could ever have been red.** The defect this repo keeps
  producing is not a broken test — it is a passing one that cannot fail. Measured, all in one day: a
  version gate that no merge could trip because nothing bumped the number it read; a reserve gated on
  a non-zero exit code, so a chair that hit its turn cap and exited 0 was never extended; a parity law
  re-pointed at the arguments passed IN rather than the deps that came OUT, so deleting a wire left it
  green; a reachability ratchet whose corpus contained the file the fields were declared in, so every
  field matched its own declaration and the pin sat at 0 forever; and a spread-recovery line matching
  `{` against a string built with `ch !== "{"`. Every one of them read as coverage.

  So the check on a check is mechanical and takes a minute: **break the thing on purpose and watch the
  law go red.** Delete the wire, inject the dead field, remove the grant. If it stays green you have
  learned something far more important than the feature you were building. And verify the sabotage
  actually landed — a probe whose anchor string did not match reports a comfortable pass while testing
  nothing, which is the same defect one level up.

- **Look under rocks.** This substrate can do more than its clerical description — strange
  data through consistent processes finds connections nobody asked for. When you see one,
  surface it.

## What this repo is

coltrane is a **methodology engine** — a typed substrate for defining agents, composing
standards (multi-phase workflows), dispatching gigs (runs), and sealing every output to
a content-addressed ledger.

It is an **MCP server**. You (Claude Code) are the natural client. The repo ships its own
`.mcp.json` pointing at `dist/src/server_entry.js`, so after `npm run build` the 58 tools
become available when Claude opens the directory. The same registry is host-mountable: a
deployment imports `createToolSurface` (subpath `./tool_surface`) and mounts the identical
surface over HTTP against an org genome store (subpath `./genome_store`) — there is one
surface, whatever the transport. It is also a **command line** (`coltrane …`), including a
queue worker (`coltrane work`) that claims a queued gig from an org store, runs it under the
claimed gig's own id, and drains the results.

This repo gives you:
- a way to **define agents** as content-addressed definitions, not glue code
- a way to **compose standards** (multi-phase workflows) that an agent runs against
- a way to **dispatch gigs** (real runs) and observe sealed outputs
- a way to **evolve agents** under typed invariants — change goes through `agent_evolve`,
  not free-form prompt drift
- a way to **read the chain** — every run produces a `genome_hash` + `run_fingerprint`
  in the append-only ledger; every output carries its `content_sha` plus the `input_shas` of
  exactly what it consumed (the provenance chain is engine-stamped, no agent hashing), and a
  run records its actual model spend (`usage`)
  - **What the run hashes cover.** `genome_hash` is deterministic and stable across machines
    and implementations *for a given structure*: the standard's phase graph plus each agent's
    slug, primitives, `input_types`, `output_types`, domain. It does **not** cover `identity`,
    `method`, `constraints`, `behavioral_primitives`, `allowed_tools`, model tier, or
    `skill_slugs` — so an `agent_evolve` that rewrites an agent's method and widens its tools
    leaves `genome_hash` unmoved, and a skilled run can be indistinguishable from an unskilled
    one in the chain. This is a deliberate structural hash (see #220), not an oversight. When
    you need to compare *behavior*, use the authoring-time `content_hash`/`effective_hash`
    that `agent_define` / `agent_evolve` seal as `kind:"genome_mutation"` ledger rows — those
    hash the full canonical definition.

It is NOT:
- a prompt manager
- a vector-store-with-extra-steps
- a free-text RAG framework
- a langchain replacement

(The non-targets are part of the definition.)

## Definition classes — your primary surface

When a user asks you to define, compose, evolve, or dispatch, route through the
appropriate class. Three classes have the full define→evolve→promote MCP
surface; `skills` and `evals` are loaded from on-disk files but only `skills`
has a promote tool today (evals are declared inside the standard that uses them).

| class | what it is | MCP tool |
|---|---|---|
| `types` | typed schemas for inputs/outputs | `type_register · type_extend` |
| `agents` | agent definitions (charters, capabilities, skill bindings) | `agent_define · agent_evolve · agent_promote` |
| `standards` | multi-phase workflows that agents run | `standard_compose · standard_simulate · standard_promote` |
| `charts` | ARRANGEMENTS: one gig as a performance of many standards — movements, typed between-movement edges, arrangement-level approval gates, a budget envelope, and the venue it is held in | `chart_define · chart_browse` |
| `venues` | the institution's configured performance space: equipment (a deny-by-default tool CEILING), doors (ingress/egress origin allowlists), digest-pinned installs, credential surface, lifecycle, and the accountable office | `venue_define · venue_browse` |
| `skills` | reusable cognitive primitives — bound into agents by slug, or CARRIED on an agent's own record (load-only + promote) | `skill_promote` |
| `evals` | verdict shapes that judge gig outputs (load-only; declared with the standard) | _none — declared in the standard file_ |
| `tours` | COMMITTED WORK: a Tour is the institution-visible aggregation of committed future gigs (`Bookings`) drawing over declared `Resources` — the binding middle place between an intention (`Northstar`) and a settled actual (`GigLedgerEntry`), the encumbrance between the appropriation ceiling and the expenditure. Acceptance reuses `LawCheck` and the same `evaluate()`; admissibility returns the same `AdmissibilityResult`. | _file-shaped under `tours/`, loaded by `loadTours` (src/institution_loader.ts) and returned in the genome; no MCP surface yet. Gates: `tests/committed_work/` (6 law files) and `docs/specs/the-binding-middle-place.md`_ |
| `institutions` | institutional instances: an institution, its chairs (with dispatch grants), assignments, forebears, lineage edges | _file-shaped under `institutions/`, loaded by `loadInstitutions` (src/institution_loader.ts) and returned in the genome alongside every other class; TOTAL by contract — a malformed document becomes a per-file `load_error` and drops out rather than failing the load. No MCP authoring surface yet. Gates: `tests/institution_loader.test.ts` (8 laws incl. wiring + ordering) and `tests/default_genome_quartet.test.ts`_ |
| `bearing_laws` | SEALABLE CANON, not executable standards: ADICO records (kind `"bearing-law"`) of an obligation a LEGAL PERSON bears — an executed SAFE portfolio, a payment note, a delivery SOW — researched against real instruments, destined for Nomos's seal. NO phases, seats no agents, and NEVER dispatchable: it is admitted to `bearing_laws`, not `standards`, and dispatch resolves against the standards map. | _file-shaped under `standards/` (kind-discriminated), validated by `BearingLawSchema` (src/genome_schema.ts) in the loader's standards pass; a shape failure is a soft per-file `load_error`. No MCP surface yet. Gate: `tests/bearing_law_loader.test.ts` (incl. the pinned seal-genome content hashes)_ |

Discoverability parity is an invariant: every class you can author over MCP you can list
over MCP (`type_browse · skill_browse · agent_browse · standard_browse · chart_browse ·
venue_browse`), pinned by `tests/genome_browse_parity.test.ts`.

**A venue is a ceiling, never a grant.** Where a chart names a venue, the effective tool set of
every seated agent is `agent.allowed_tools ∩ venue.equipment.tools` — so a room can only ever
narrow a player. An agent whose entire grant set lies outside the room refuses the chart at
COMPOSE time (rule R10), and a venue the genome does not hold is a dead name that fails closed,
exactly as an unresolvable tool grant does. What is NOT implemented: realizing a room from its
contract and verifying it by behavioural probe. That is a lower layer; the schema is the
statically-checkable half.

## Six cognitive primitives

Map 1:1 to output types:

| primitive | output type |
|---|---|
| SENSE | Signal |
| INTERPRET | Interpretation |
| JUDGE | Judgment |
| PLAN | Plan |
| CREATE | Artifact |
| VERIFY | Verdict |

Don't invent new primitives. Compose with what's here.

---

## Three identity hashes per definition

Every definition has three hashes — read this before you mutate anything:

- `content_hash` — the bytes themselves
- `dependency_hash` — relational closure (who depends on whom)
- `effective_hash` — the binding (content × dependency in a context)

Two byte-identical definitions in different contexts produce different `effective_hash`.
This is by design. Don't treat hashes as interchangeable.

---

## The genome's shape is one Zod source

Every genome class — agent, standard, skill, eval, domain-type — derives its shape from a
single Zod schema in `src/genome_schema.ts`. From that one schema come the TypeScript type, the
constructor/validator (`Schema.parse`, loss-free), the MCP tool's `input_schema` (generated by
`zodToMcpProps`, never hand-written), and the loader's file validation. Add a field once there
and every restatement follows — there is no second place to edit.

When you change a class's shape, change the schema. Do **not** hand-edit a TypeScript type, an
MCP `input_schema`, or a loader check to "match" — that's the drift this collapses, and the
drift reds in `tests/genome_schema_drift.test.ts` will catch a hand-rolled surface that diverges.

---

## Skills travel with the player; the institution supplies the data

Method and technique belong to the **agent**; law and data belong to the **institution**.

- `Agent.skill_slugs` REFERENCES the shared repertoire (`skills/<slug>/`). `Agent.skills` CARRIES
  full definitions on the agent's own record — the technique it grew, portable into any
  institution that seats it. Resolution unions both, **carried-first**, so a carried definition
  shadows a same-slug repertoire package and a slug covered by a carried one is not dangling.
- A skill declares `hydration` slots (name → `{type, description?, required?, binding?}`) instead
  of hard-coding one house's data. `binding: "institution"` (the default) is filled at SEAT time
  from a chair's `supplies`; `binding: "gig"` is filled at DISPATCH time from the gig payload —
  the chair contract's formal parameters, whose argument list is the dispatch input.
- A required INSTITUTION-bound slot nothing supplies is a **dead slot** and `composeStandard`
  refuses it (same defect class as a tool grant with no provider). Gig-bound slots are not
  compose time's business — nothing is known about a run's arguments before the run.
- Chairs state two tiers: `required_skills` is the floor (it refuses a seating);
  `preferred_skills` is soft and unchecked, including its names — a chair may prefer a technique
  no agent has grown yet.
- A seating may cite `technique_evidence` (`{source, claim}`) on the chair assignment, which is
  what makes "why this player in this chair" a record rather than a recollection.

The gate is `tests/skills_agent_carried.test.ts`; the shipped demonstration is bill's carried
`structure-conformance` plus the quartet's `structure-builder` chair, which supplies its
`house-style` slot and leaves its `target-paths` slot to the gig.

---

## Tool grants resolve to providers — and fail closed

An agent's `allowed_tools` is not a free-text wish list. At dispatch each grant resolves to a
**provider**: a host-builtin (`Read`/`Bash`/`WebFetch`…), an MCP tool (`mcp__<server>__<tool>`,
wired into the spawn's `--mcp-config`), or an in-house engine tool (`output_write`, … — the
engine's own MCP surface, bridged in by `bootstrapServerDeps`). A grant that resolves to none
is a **dead name** — the spawn would advertise a tool it can't back — so dispatch **fails
closed** instead of confabulating.

A browser is special: granting `mcp__playwright__*` requires the agent to declare a
`browser_grant` (an origin allowlist), which builds a **deny-by-default caged browser** scoped
to exactly those origins (`--allowed-origins`, server-enforced; isolated + headless). No
`browser_grant`, no browser — the grant is unresolvable and the chair fails closed. Author
capability deliberately: the grant string IS the policy, and the cage is the blast-radius bound.

### Role tokens: the repository's layout decides what a path grant reaches

An agent may grant a **role token** instead of a path: `Write(@source)`, `Edit(@tests)`,
`Bash(@laws)`. The repository answers what the role means, in `coltrane.layout.json` at the root
of the genome tree the gig runs against (`paths`: `source`/`tests`/`migrations`/`scripts`/`docs`,
each a list of globs; `commands`: `build`/`test`/`laws`/`ship_dry`, each a list of command
prefixes). Its shape is `LayoutSchema` in `src/genome_schema.ts`; a malformed file is a load
error and is treated as absent. The drain never reads its clone's file: it takes the org store's
layout row for the gig's repository (`resolveWorkingRepo(claim)`). A new repository shape is a
layout file, never an agent amendment.

`resolveSeatGrants` (`src/layout_grants.ts`) is the one resolution both invokers and `runGig` use,
in this order: (1) expand role tokens through the layout (path role → `<Tool>(<glob>)` per glob,
command role → `Bash(<prefix>:*)`), literals untouched; (2) narrow Write/Edit to the change's
`target_paths` (absent → no narrowing, recorded `target_paths_applied: false`; `[]` → no writes);
(3) narrow by the venue's equipment. Only step 1 may produce a string the agent did not write;
every later step only removes or narrows. `chair_complete` records `resolved_grants` and
`target_paths_applied`.

**Fail closed.** A role the layout does not declare, or any role token with no layout, grants
nothing and the chair is refused at dispatch naming the role — never a `**` default. A
`target_paths` entry with glob metacharacters refuses the chair, naming the entry. The completions
invoker refuses any path-scoped Write/Edit, because it cannot carry the scope to the model.

**No self-widening, and its known limit.** Whenever a seat's Write/Edit covers
`coltrane.layout.json`, the spawn is denied `Write(coltrane.layout.json)`/`Edit(coltrane.layout.json)`.
**Bash grants are not path-scoped**: a seat holding a Bash prefix that writes files (`sed -i`, `cp`,
`tee`) can still write any path, the layout file included. That is a known limit, not an enforced
boundary.

---

## Tool routing — the most common gotcha

When operating in this repo via the coltrane MCP server, prefer **coltrane tools** over
built-in Claude Code tools for coltrane-shaped operations:

- composing a standard → `standard_compose`, **NOT** Write
- writing a Plan output → `output_write` with type `Plan`, **NOT** Edit
- defining an agent → `agent_define`, **NOT** dropping a markdown file in `agents/`
- checking system state → `system_health` / `system_audit`, **NOT** ad-hoc grep
- looking up a type → `type_resolve` / `type_browse`, **NOT** Read on schema files

If you bypass the coltrane tool, the genome doesn't see your work, hashes don't update,
and the ledger goes out of sync. **The MCP surface is the genome's mouth — use it.**

Use built-in Claude Code tools only for:
- reading source files (`src/`, `tests/`) to understand the engine
- editing TypeScript source when working on the engine itself
- running `npm` commands

---

## The repo genome is the base repertoire — org genomes live in stores

The genome in THIS tree is the **default repertoire** every deployment starts from: the demo
agents, the named quartet (john · bill · miles, seated by `institutions/quartet.json`), the
default standards, the base skills. An organization's own authored definitions do NOT live
here — they live in the organization's **genome store** (a PostgREST-shaped instance store),
loaded per-caller at the surface. The `GenomeStore` port (`src/genome_store.ts`) has three
backings: files (this tree), a member's JWT over PostgREST, and an agent capability token
over definer RPCs. One reconstruction is shared by all store backings so the views cannot
drift.

Authorization for running standards sits **on the chair contract**: a chair's `caps` may
carry `{"grant": "dispatch", "standards": [...]}` (`DispatchCapGrantSchema`), an agent is
seated by a chair assignment, and a credential presented by the incumbent may only narrow
what the chair grants — never widen it. Drain credentials are org-level (the organization is
the resource boundary); agent tokens are per-agent and issued only by a human governor.

---

## Base players — first-class subagents

Coltrane ships a base set of Claude Code subagents under `agents/players/<name>.md` —
each one is a markdown subagent definition with a YAML frontmatter (slug,
tools_allowlist, charter) plus a prose system prompt.

These are the source-of-truth: when a runtime needs an agent surface, the player
definition is the bytes it renders from — not a duplicate definition to keep in sync.

Base players shipped today:
- **chain-audit-keeper** — sealing discipline, audit trail, ledger hygiene, verdict-naming
- **substrate-edge-keeper** — where the engine ends and the host begins; boundary discipline
- **methodology-cadence-keeper** — phase cadence; whether the work is converging or stalling
- **illumination-reviewer** — surfaces what a change reveals about the next move
- **audience-modeler** — who's listening; what shape they need; register-matching

Each base player has an e2e test in `tests/e2e/` that drives it through representative
gigs and asserts behavioral invariants — when the player evolves, the test catches drift.

When a user customizes one, they should run the base e2e test first to know the
baseline behavior is intact.

---

## Change discipline

Every meaningful change ships with these fields, **stated before the work starts**:

| field | what |
|---|---|
| `scope` | what will ship |
| `playwright_test_path` (or `vitest_test_path`) | the test that proves the scope, RED-first |
| `stop_condition` | when to stop |
| `non_goals` | what this change is NOT |
| `run_protocol` | how the work runs |
| `outcome` | completed · partial · refined · not-completed |

Test must land RED before code. Code makes it green. Hollow-green (test passes for the
wrong reason) is the failure mode the discipline closes.

---

## The litmus test

```bash
rm -rf .coltrane-cache/    # nuke any materialized state
npm run verify             # rebuilds from genome files
```

If the suite stays green after deleting every materialized artifact, **the genome is the
source of truth**. If it doesn't, something cached state where it shouldn't have.

---

## Don't

- Don't write to `core_types/` or `domain_types/` directly — use `type_register` / `type_extend`
- Don't add fake agents under `agents/` — use `agent_define`
- Don't ship hollow-green tests. Ship honest RED + fix-pass, or hold the work.
- Don't mutate base band players without updating their e2e test in lockstep
- Don't strip the band players from a fork — the discipline ships with them
- Don't bypass MCP tools for coltrane-shaped operations (see Tool Routing above)

---

## Compute economy

Every inference call costs real watts, water, and dollars. Treat tokens as scarce.

- Silence is the cheapest answer
- A distinct point earns its cost
- Echoing what's already said does not

Write less, more carved. Don't pad.

---

## When stuck

1. `system_health` — what does coltrane think its state is?
2. `system_audit` — what's the chain saying?
3. `output_query` / `output_trace` — what's the last gig actually produced?
4. `charter_read` — what was this agent's promise?
5. Read `tests/e2e/operator_dispatches_standard.spec.ts` — the working examples are the manual.

The tests are user manuals. If you're not sure how a workflow runs, the e2e test for it
is the canonical example.
