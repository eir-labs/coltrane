/**
 * Two backing ledgers behind ONE `Ledger` handle, routed by `entry.kind` (WO-F06).
 *
 *   kind:"genome_mutation" → genomeLedger  (git-TRACKED `genome/ledger.jsonl`; ships with the repo)
 *   kind:"gig" | "governance" → gigLedger  (gitignored `.coltrane/ledger.jsonl`; machine-local)
 *
 * WHY a wrapper rather than threading two ledgers to every append site, or a `kind` parameter on
 * `Ledger.append`: `append` is reached from ~a dozen seal and seal-adjacent sites across
 * `src/genome_writer.ts` and `src/server.ts`, several of them un-audited. A per-call-site split has
 * unbounded blast radius, and a `kind` parameter would break the interface contract for every caller.
 * This confines the routing decision to the ONE fact that already discriminates the entry — its own
 * `kind` — and leaves the interface, every append() caller, and every reader untouched.
 *
 * `governance` rides with `gig` deliberately: WO-F06 tracks only `genome_mutation`, and keeping
 * governance on the runtime side preserves the invariant "only genome_mutation travels with the
 * genome" and keeps governance rows out of the orphan-detector's seal source. Reversible if
 * governance provenance is later required to ship.
 *
 * Reads UNION both sources so `genome_reload` and every existing consumer still see one ledger. A
 * kind-filtered read short-circuits to the single side that can hold that kind, so a gig query never
 * parses the genome file (and vice versa) — the union is paid for only by an unfiltered read.
