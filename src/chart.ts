// THE CHART — one gig as a performance of many standards.
//
// A standard is a phase graph over chairs. A chart is the same idea one level up: a typed DAG over
// STANDARDS, where each MOVEMENT names one and typed EDGES carry a movement's SEALED OUTPUTS into
// the next movement's entry chairs. Everything a standard already refuses at compose time, a chart
// refuses at compose time too — a cycle, an edge naming a type nothing seals, an unclassified
// conditional flow, an entry slot with no provider, a gate key colliding with a human chair — so a
// misarranged performance dies where it is authored, never at minute nine.
//
// THREE SEAMS THIS MODULE OWNS, AND WHY THEY ARE HERE AND NOT IN runtime.ts:
//
//  1. COMPOSE (`composeChart`). Eleven rules in a fixed firing order, each independently testable
//     against a minimal violating input, returning a STRUCTURED violation list. A rule that fires
//     stops the walk: a chart is refused for one named reason, not for a heap of cascading ones.
//  2. IDENTITY (`chartHash`). The arrangement's own hash, folded into `run_fingerprint` in the slot
//     that held `genome_hash`. For the degenerate one-movement chart it SHORT-CIRCUITS to
//     `genomeHash(standard)` verbatim, which is what makes a single-standard gig's fingerprint
//     byte-identical to what it was before charts existed.
//  3. PERFORM (`runChart`). Walk the movements in topological order, calling `runGig` per movement.
//     The runtime stays the thing that runs ONE standard; the chart is the thing that arranges
//     several. Between movements — the only place a stop is free — the chart checks the approval
//     gates and the budget envelope, and records what completed so a resume never re-derives it.
//
// Spec: sealed design gig 51fda6b1 (product-design-v1), design-concept `chart-schema-spec-001`,
// verified by a deliver-phase verdict (7/7) and approved by the governor. The ChartSchema itself
// lives with every other genome class in src/genome_schema.ts — one Zod source, no exceptions.
