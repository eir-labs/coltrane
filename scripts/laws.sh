# THE LAWS, COUNTED — an exact gate on this repo's own suite.
#
# THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES (verifier, n=232), and it was the law under everything else:
# `npm test` was a bare `vitest run` with no expected count anywhere — not in package.json,
# not in scripts/, not in either workflow. Every other lane in this program is pinned and
# matches its files (the sibling lanes pin theirs at 98, 116 unit / 78 pgTAP, 13, and 5).
# COLTRANE, THE LARGEST SUITE, WAS NOT.
#
# What that costs: a file that fails to COLLECT does exit 1, so an import that throws is
# caught. But a DELETED law is SILENT — the run simply reports a smaller number and passes.
# Demonstrated by her hand on main: two law files -> "Tests 17 passed" exit 0; one file moved
# away -> "Tests 12 passed" exit 0. The suite went 3458 -> 3484 -> 3487 across six PRs in one
# day and nothing asserted what it should be, which means every green reported in that time
# rested on a number that could not tell "more laws" from "different laws".
#
# BOTH NUMBERS ARE PINNED, deliberately. Test count alone would catch a deleted file, but it
# cannot say WHAT changed — and "3487 -> 3480" is a puzzle where "one file went missing" is
# an answer. Files catch a lost suite; tests catch a lost law inside a surviving suite.
#
# Growth is a DELIBERATE EDIT of the numbers below, in the same commit as the new laws. Exact
# (-ne), never a floor: a floor lets a lost law hide behind a new one.

# THE FILES DELEGATED AWAY FROM THE ROOT BAND, by name.
#
# The verifier caught this message overclaiming: it said "plus every band, exact" while the
# DOCKER band (test:room, tests/venue_live/vitest.config.ts, run by ci.yml) was the one band
# nothing pinned. Her fix was EXPECTED_ROOM_FILES=1. Measuring it suggested a stronger law:
# `find` sees 350 test files and the root band collects 347, and the three-file difference is
# the whole of what any other config is responsible for.
#
# So instead of pinning one more count, this pins the DELEGATION ITSELF: the set of files the
# root band does not collect must be EXACTLY this list. A file that leaves the root band —
# excluded, moved under a band directory, or delegated to a new config — must be named here,
# in the commit that moves it. That catches the room band (it is in the list), and it catches
# the thing a room-band count could not: A TEST FILE THAT NO BAND RUNS AT ALL. A dead law
# nobody executes reports nothing and passes forever, which is the same silence this whole
# script exists to end, one level further out.
