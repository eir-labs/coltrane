// Parent-relay process for the Coltrane MCP server.
//
// The problem this solves: when Claude Code spawns the Coltrane server as an
// MCP child via stdio, it holds the pipe to that specific PID. Rebuilding
// `src/` produces new bytes in `dist/`, but the running PID is still executing
// the old bytes. Restarting the PID picks up the new bytes — and severs the
// stdio pipe Claude Code is holding, which ends the MCP connection for that
// conversation.
//
// The fix: a stdio-proxy parent that holds the pipe to Claude Code forever
// and spawns the actual Coltrane server as a *child*. To pick up new bytes,
// the relay kills the child and re-spawns it; the parent-side pipe never
// moves, so Claude Code's connection survives.
//
// Wire shape:
