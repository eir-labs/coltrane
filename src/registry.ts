 * `required` — are already backstopped at runtime: `output_validation.ts` rejects an empty
 * floor array outright and enforces `item_requires` per item, whatever the subtype's schema
 * says. So they change nothing observable, and refusing them would reject types the engine's
 * own suite builds ON PURPOSE (`seal_core_invariant_wiring.test.ts` constructs a loose
 * `loose-doc` precisely to prove the floor catches what the schema permits).
 *
 * A type mismatch is different in kind: the floor wants an array and the schema wants a
 * string, so NO payload satisfies both and the type is dead on arrival. That is #264's live
