// The local, file-backed gig queue — the third gig backing, the offline sibling of the two HTTP
// seams (postgrestQueueGig / rpcQueueGig, src/genome_store.ts:532,:493). It closes the asymmetry the
// SPEC (docs/specs/SPEC-local-queue-contract.md) names: the genome port already ships a LOCAL sibling
// (fileGenomeStore, src/genome_store.ts:77) so a genome can be READ from files, but the queue port
// had none — so an open-source user could run gigs in-process yet never enqueue. This module is that
// missing sibling: clone → build → enqueue → `coltrane work` in another terminal claims and runs it,
// with no Supabase, no service origin, no cdk_ key, no minting backend.
//
// MUTUAL EXCLUSION WITHOUT A DATABASE OR A LOCK. State is a directory-per-state layout under `root`
// (queued/, claimed/, parked/, done/, failed/, cancelled/), and every transition is a single POSIX
// rename(2), which is atomic within a filesystem. A claim renames queued/<id> → claimed/<id>: the
// winner's rename removes the source, and every loser's rename of the same source fails ENOENT — that
// is how a loser learns it lost (maildir new/→cur/, cr.yp.to; FSQ tmp/→queue/→done/). No lockfile
// (which would leave stale residue reintroducing the race), no in-process mutex (which cannot cross
// the server / `coltrane work` process boundary this queue exists to bridge), no SQLite (a forbidden
// dependency). node's own fs is sufficient, and the atomicity argument depends on staying on one FS.
//
// LEASE, not lock. A claim carries a lease {holder, renewed_at, expires_at} embedded in the moved
// file, so one atomic rename carries the claim AND its lease together — there is never a window where
// a claim exists without its lease. The holder renews with heartbeat (strictly advances the lease);
// a crashed holder's grip falls open by timeout, and reap() returns lapsed claims to queued while
// never touching a fresh one. A clock may be injected (opts.clock) so lease/reap laws are
// deterministic and fast; it defaults to Date.now().
//
// IDEMPOTENT EFFECT. Because a lapsed lease lets a second worker re-run a gig, the honest guarantee
// is at-least-once + idempotent-effect: complete() seals the output under content_sha (the same
// sha256Hex(canonJson(...)) primitive the rest of the codebase uses), a re-run with the SAME output
// re-seals rather than duplicating (duplicated:true), and a re-run that would seal a DIFFERENT output
// fails closed rather than forking.
//
// This module is NOT wired into any surface (deps.queueGig / deps.cancelGig) — shipping the module
// and its laws going green is a separate act from selecting it as a backing.
