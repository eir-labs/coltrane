/** AN EXPORT WITH NO CALLER IS A MECHANISM NOBODY CAN REACH.
 *
 *  A test suite proves a mechanism WORKS. Nothing in this repo asked whether one is REACHABLE, and
 *  the difference is where the defects have been living: `venue.repo_url` carried five unit laws and
 *  three live container laws while no dispatch could ever trigger it; `drainPreflight` was a complete
 *  123-line collector nothing called; `turn_reserve` had eleven passing laws and zero of twenty-two
 *  standards setting it. Each was green, and each did nothing.
 *
 *  A sweep on 2026-08-20 found 60 exported symbols that are exercised by tests, exported from no
 *  public entrypoint, and called nowhere in src/. The sweep's own example then was `makeBifrostInvoker`,
 *  a second AgentInvoker named for one vendor's transport; the completions port superseded it (one
 *  general OpenAI-compatible connector, any endpoint) and it was deleted on 2026-09-23. NOTE it was
 *  never IN this count — it was exported from index.ts, and this predicate counts only symbols exported
 *  from no public entrypoint — so deleting it left the pin where it was.
 *
 *  WHY THIS IS A RATCHET AND NOT A ZERO. Demanding zero today would fail on 59 pre-existing cases and
 *  make the suite red for reasons unrelated to whatever change is being reviewed — which teaches
 *  people to ignore it, the failure mode `isolate_audit_spine.ts` already documents for flaky gates.
 *  So it pins the CURRENT count and fails only when the number GROWS. It stops the bleeding without
 *  demanding a 59-item cleanup as the price of admission, and every genuine reduction is a chance to
 *  lower the pin.
 *
 *  THE PREDICATE IS DELIBERATELY CONSERVATIVE, because the first three drafts of this sweep were each
 *  wrong in a different direction. A symbol counts as unreachable only when ALL of: it is exported
 *  from src/; it appears nowhere else in src/ INCLUDING its own defining file (same-file use is real
 *  use); it is not re-exported from a public entrypoint (index.ts / tool_surface.ts / genome_store.ts,
 *  where "no internal caller" is correct by design); and tests reference it at least four times, so a
 *  barely-touched helper does not register as a load-bearing orphan. */

/** The count as measured on 2026-08-20. LOWER THIS when orphans are wired or removed; never raise it. */
// 60 -> 19 on 2026-08-20. The drop is not work done; it is the law becoming ACCURATE. Before it
// resolved `export * from "./x.js"`, forty-one symbols in wildcard-exported modules counted as
// unreachable while being fully importable by a consumer — so the ratchet sat three times looser
// than the truth and would have absorbed a real orphan without noticing. Lowered per this file's
// own instruction ("If it SHRANK, lower PINNED_ORPHANS").
// 19 -> 20 on 2026-09-17, the same correction in the other direction, and the only kind of raise this
// pin admits: no mechanism was added. compileRepositoryIndex (src/repo_index.ts) has had no src caller
// since it landed, but its only law reached it through a computed `await import(href)`, which this
// ratchet cannot see, so it did not count as tested. tests/spec_law_neighbourhood.test.ts imports it
// statically and the existing orphan became visible. Wiring it (slice 4 of the seat-briefing plan,
// the law-neighbourhood brief) must lower this back to 19. A raise that names no pre-existing orphan
// made visible is a new mechanism without a caller and is refused.
