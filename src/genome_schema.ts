// ── Venue — the institution's configured performance space ────────────────────────────────────
//
// A venue states what EXISTS to be acted with when a gig runs: which tools resolve, which doors
// open inward and outward, what is installed, and which classes of credential may legitimately be
// present. It is an institution-level object (one institution owns it; an institution may operate
// several) and it is a CEILING, never a grant: the authority a seated agent actually holds is its
// own `allowed_tools` INTERSECTED with `equipment.tools`, so a room can only ever narrow a player.
// `composeChart` enforces that where a chart names a venue (src/chart.ts R10).
//
// The contract is deliberately a narrow waist. Nothing here is a harness escape hatch — no image
// reference, no command string, no provisioning block — because a field that can express arbitrary
// harness behaviour destroys the separation between what is declared and what realizes it. What
// this shape covers is the STATICALLY CHECKABLE half of the design: the fields an engine can
// enforce before anything runs. Realization (building the room from the contract) and verification
// by behavioural probe are a lower layer and are not modelled here.
//
// Two asymmetries are load-bearing and stated in the shape rather than in prose:
//   - `doors` separates ingress from egress, because what may reach the room and what may leave it
//     are different questions with different threat models.
//   - `installs` carries DIGESTS, not version ranges: an unpinned install names a family of rooms,
//     which would make a room's identity meaningless.

     * REQUIRED, and it must stay required — this field is what makes a Resource a BUDGET rather

     *
     * A Resource is "this much, over this window". Capacity is settled ONCE, at declaration, and
     * held as a commitment for the window; anything continuous underneath it — a decaying holding,
     * a replenishing one — determines the NEXT declaration rather than being read live inside this
     * one. That is what a budget is, and it is consistent with a layer whose subject is committed
     * work: a commitment is a stored fact even when it was computed from something continuous.
     *
     * WHAT BREAKS IF THIS GOES OPTIONAL. The tempting change is a one-off holding that "has no
     * window" — it feels like it should not need one. But a quantity with no window is a running
     * balance, and a running balance is continuously readable: ask `checkTourCapacity` enough
     * times with varying draws and binary search recovers the holder's exact remaining capacity.
     *
     * For units whose magnitude is private — a pair's earned standing, an org's runway — that is an
     * arbitrary-precision oracle reconstructed from an admissibility check that was never meant to
     * answer it. The window is what stops it: within a period the answer is a fixed declared number
     * the holder chose to commit, not a live reading of what they have.
     *
     * So a one-off holding still declares its window. It is not bureaucracy; it is the reason the
     * check can be offered at all.
