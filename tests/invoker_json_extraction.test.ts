// RED-first — the JSON extraction contract on the critical path of every sealed output.
//
// Issues under test:
//   #221 extractJson is string-blind and first-brace-anchored — it can silently seal
//        the wrong object.
//   #226 user_flow_judge carries a duplicate half-fixed extractor.
//
// Approved selection policy (deliberate contract change, blessed by the maintainer):
//   1. Enumerate candidates at EVERY `{` start position, walking with inString/escaped state.
//   2. Score: prefer a fenced candidate → then one matching `expectKeys` → then the LAST.
//   3. Throw a TYPED error carrying candidate count + a bounded excerpt of the raw text.
//   4. Accept a single-element top-level array; REJECT a multi-element one explicitly.
//   5. One shared implementation consumed by all four production call sites.
//
// `expectKeys` is derived from the RESOLVED OUTPUT SCHEMA'S PROPERTY NAMES (available at
// claude_invoker.ts:287, `schemaOf(outType)`), unioned with the output type slugs. Deriving
// it from type slugs ALONE is inert for a single-output chair: buildPrompt:148-155 asks such
// a chair for the bare data object, never wrapped in {"<type-slug>": …}; only a multi-output
// chair gets the type-keyed blob (:138-147). Both shapes are covered below.
//
// Every "today" note was verified empirically against the compiled function.
