// EVERY DECLARED TRANSPORT OWES THE FIELD THAT MAKES IT REACHABLE — AND MUST BE ONE THE ENGINE KNOWS.
//
// THE DEFECT, found while repairing three rooms the engine was silently dropping: `transport` was a
// bare `z.string()`, and the cross-field rule named only `stdio` (owes a command) and `sse` (owes a
// url). So EVERY OTHER SPELLING owed nothing and was checked by nobody:
//
//   · `"http"` — the transport three live rooms actually use for the eir-wiki server — passed with
//     no url, no command, nothing.
//   · `"banana"` passed too. A typo declared a server the realizer would hand to a client that has
//     never heard of it, discovered at use on a box nobody is watching.
//
// The openness was deliberate — the schema's own comment says a bare string keeps a future
// transport an addition rather than a breaking change. That intent survives here; what changes is
// that the future transport must be ADDED rather than merely spelled. `KNOWN_TRANSPORTS` is a named
// set that grows by a one-line edit plus teaching `buildMcpConfigs` what the new transport means —
// the same discipline as this repo's exact law-count pins: openness to the future kept, silent
// acceptance of nonsense refused.
//
// And the reachability rule is stated once, generally: stdio is reached by the command the realizer
// execs; everything else is reached over the wire, by its url. That is what `buildMcpConfigs`
// already does — it special-cases stdio and lets every other transport fall through to url-based
// handling — so the schema now says what the realizer has always meant.
