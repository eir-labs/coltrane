// Institutional-law ENFORCEMENT — the seam that makes Coltrane's own laws machine-checkable
// at the moment of action, rather than prose that sounds binding.
//
// Coltrane's public position is that an institutional law is decidable when an action is
// attempted. Today institutions/coltrane.json ships three ADICO laws whose `check.predicate`
// is a real s-expression that NOTHING evaluates, and composeStandard verifies chair caps at
// dispatch while verifying no chair obligation at all. This module is the repair: a
// zero-dependency in-house s-expression evaluator with a fixed verdict codomain, and an
// admissibility check that refuses an institution document claiming more enforcement than it
// has.
//
// GREEN STATUS. The signatures below and the `Verdict` codomain are the fixed seam authored by
// the red spec; this change fills the bodies WITHOUT touching either. The evaluator is a total
// four-plus-valued reducer over a supplied fact record; admissibility is a separate, explicitly
// invoked pure function. Neither is wired into loadGenome — a universal gate would refuse
// quartet.json (unmarked obligations, non-fact-decidable operators) and break "loads unchanged".
// See docs/specs/coltrane-enforces-its-laws.md.

/**
 * The closed verdict algebra — a strict superset of refuse/permit, grounded in XACML 3.0's
 * four-valued decision model:
 *  - PERMIT          the action is allowed (an allow atom, or a satisfied obligation).
 *  - DENY            the action is refused (a deny atom, or a breached obligation — the or_else fires).
 *  - NOT_APPLICABLE  the law does not govern this action (the guard of `(=> P Q)` is false).
 *  - UNDECIDED       well-formed, but the fact-only evaluator cannot reduce it (e.g. an operator
 *                    that needs a genome/collection/timestamp context not supplied). Never coerced
 *                    to PERMIT or DENY.
 *  - DEAD_NAME       a name declared in `check.inputs` is absent from the fact record. Fails closed,
 *                    the exact analogue of an unresolvable tool grant (runtime.ts's
 *                    resolveAgentGrants().unknown). Never PERMIT, never a DENY dressed as a decision.
 *
 * PERMIT/DENY/UNDECIDED is a deliberate strict subset of the edit-automata TERMINATE/SUPPRESS/INSERT
 * taxonomy (Ligatti, Bauer & Walker 2005): SUPPRESS and INSERT are a named future gap, extendable
 * behind this same interface.
