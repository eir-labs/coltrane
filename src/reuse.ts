// Reuse a sealed output instead of re-deriving it.
//
// ONE idea, two ranges. A gig CHECKPOINT lets a failed run restart from the phase it died
// on instead of from zero (reuse across attempts at the same gig); a chair-level REUSE CACHE
// lets a chair be served from a prior gig's sealed output instead of invoking the model
// (reuse across gigs). Both answer the same question — "is there an existing sealed output
// that stands in for the one I am about to pay to derive?" — and both live or die on the
// same discipline: an exact, defensible key, and a refusal to serve anything that would not
// pass the seal boundary today.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT MERELY AN OPTIMISATION. Substituting a sealed output means the artifact an
// operator acts on was produced under conditions that are no longer visible in the run. If
// the genome moved between the two, the provenance chain silently splices two different
// systems together: sealed outputs from run A consumed by chairs from genome B, with nothing
// in `input_shas`, `genome_hash` or `run_fingerprint` recording that it happened. So every
// substitution here is gated on a stated IDENTITY, and every substitution that happens is
// REPORTED. A silent saving is indistinguishable from a bug.
//
// THE GOVERNING ASYMMETRY (borrowed, deliberately, from the downstream precedent in
// grant-writing-coltrane's `dashboard/src/lib/requirements-cache.ts`): a MISS IS FREE — it
// costs the cold run that would have happened anyway. A WRONG HIT IS NOT. Every ambiguous
// case below therefore resolves to "do the work".
//
// PURITY. Key derivation and entry validation are pure functions of their arguments — no
// clock, no filesystem, no registry handle. The file-backed stores at the bottom are the only
// I/O. That split is what makes the correctness half exhaustively testable.

 *    the resume gate INHERITS this recorded hash instead — see the runtime resume gate and the
 *    inheritance-vs-waiver note on `runIdentityMismatch` below.)
 *  - `model_version` — a run whose first half was produced by one model and second half by

 *    misdescribes the outputs it covers. Cheap to check; usually "unknown" on both sides, so

 *  - `depth` — #237 made depth shape what the model is asked for. A `skim` half stitched to a
 *    `deep` half is two different pipelines wearing one manifest.
 *  - `canonical_form_version` — content_shas computed under two canonical forms are not
 *    comparable, so every hash-based check below would be comparing incomparable things.
 *
 * NOT included: `run_fingerprint`. It is a RESULT identity, not a run identity — it is
