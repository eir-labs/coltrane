  //     sealed. Refused (never silently run cold) if the genome, its PRODUCERS, payload, model,
  //     depth or a domain type moved since; the reply then carries `resume_refused` + `drift`.
  //   reuse — allow chair-level cache reads AND writes. A chair whose producer, resolved
  //     inputs and payload hash to a prior sealed output is served from it instead of invoked.
  // `skipped` / `resumed_from` / `reuse` on the response say exactly what did not run and why.
  //
  // `company_id` is GONE, found by the guard added with the same change. It was advertised and
  // never read — the #237 shape (advertised, silently discarded). It is worse than a merely
  // dead argument because it is TENANCY-shaped: a caller passing it to scope a run to a company
  // would reasonably believe the run was scoped, and nothing in the engine reads it. The engine
  // deliberately does not do tenancy — `principal` on the ledger is documented as provenance
  // and explicitly NOT an access control — so the honest move is to stop advertising a
  // guarantee it does not make.
  //
  // Sweeping the guard across all 37 tools then found `company_id` advertised and unread on
  // charter_read and charter_suggest_update too, so it is gone from the MCP surface entirely.
  // It survives only as a FIELD on the AccessGrant object (src/access_grant.ts), where it
  // describes the grant a caller passes in rather than promising the engine will scope by it.
  //
  // `approvals` + `approved_by` are the human seat's door. A gig that reaches a chair marked
  // `human: true` PARKS (`status: "awaiting_approval"`, the reply naming the chair in
  // `awaiting`) until the incumbent's verdict is supplied here, keyed by chair role; the
  // verdict then seals through the same gate as every other output, under `approved_by`.
  // Undiscoverable, they would be an approval gate no operator could pass — #234 again, on
  // the one control whose whole purpose is to be exercised by a person.
  // `chart_slug` is the second way to name what a gig performs, and it is EXCLUSIVE with
  // `standard_slug`: "a standard AND a chart" names two performances, "neither" names none, and a
  // single-standard dispatch already IS the one-movement chart. Both are optional at the schema
  // level so no existing caller's shape breaks; the exactly-one refinement lives in the handler
  // (dispatchTarget, src/chart.ts). A chart dispatch's reply carries the ARRANGEMENT's manifest —
  // chart_hash, the per-movement roll-up, cumulative spend against the envelope — where a standard
  // dispatch carries the run's.
  // #20 — `gig_input_omitted` is the caller's statement that it passed NO payload (distinct from an
  // explicit `input: {}`). On an approve-only resume whose every remaining chair is human, an omitted
  // payload inherits the checkpoint's recorded gig_input_sha instead of drifting to sha256('{}') and
  // refusing; a supplied `input` leaves this false, so a disagreeing payload still gates
  // (src/runtime.ts). The handler reads it, so #234 requires it be advertised here — it is a real
  // control, not an internal signal, and a caller must be able to find it.

// ── WHAT EACH VERB DOES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. Every tool the engine advertises described itself by its CATEGORY:
// createToolSurface built `description: `${t.category} tool`` (server.ts), so all 54 verbs
// reached every MCP client as "run tool", "build tool", "understand tool", "improve tool" or
// "manage_context tool". The description is the field a model reads to choose a verb, so the
// surface offered fifty-four choices and five distinct hints — over stdio and over the hosted
// endpoint alike. It was never a placeholder awaiting content; it was computed, so nothing
// looked unfinished and nothing could notice.
//
// These are keyed by slug rather than inlined because the defs above are already single lines
// carrying two generated schemas, and a reader comparing wording across fifty-four verbs needs
// them in one place. ABSENT MUST MEAN DECLINE: a slug with no entry throws at module load
// (below) rather than falling back to something plausible, and `tests/mcp_tools_describe.test.ts`
// refuses a description that merely restates the category or the slug.
