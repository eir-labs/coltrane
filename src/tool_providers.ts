// Tool-grant → provider resolution (#185). An agent's `allowed_tools` is a set of grants, each of
// which resolves to one of three provider classes:
//   - host-builtin (Read/Write/Edit/Bash/Glob/Grep/WebFetch/WebSearch/…): provided by the Claude
//     runtime, governed by --allowedTools + code_tool_access. No MCP server needed.
//   - mcp: provided by an MCP server (e.g. a browser server) that must be wired into the spawn's
//     --mcp-config. The OSS engine ships this RESOLUTION machinery; a deployment registers the
//     actual server config (the server itself is deployment-provided).
//   - in_house: a runtime primitive (e.g. output_write) the engine provides directly.
// A grant that resolves to NONE of these is a DEAD NAME — the prompt lists a tool the spawn can't
// provide, so the model confabulates. resolveToolGrants surfaces those as `unknown` so dispatch can
// fail closed instead of launching a spawn that advertises tools it cannot back.
