// genome_store.ts — the GenomeStore port. Governor ruling: GENOME IS NOT LOCAL. The hosted
// Coltrane MCP is the Coltrane MCP — the full tool surface, functioning against the Supabase
// store — so the engine needs ONE port for "where do definitions live", with two backings:
//
//   * fileGenomeStore(root)      — the existing loader/writer, unchanged behavior. Local dev
//     and the stdio server keep reading/writing genome files on disk.
//   * postgrestGenomeStore(ctx)  — loads the five genome tables over PostgREST (the caller's
//     bearer rides the Authorization header, so RLS is the scope) and reconstructs the SAME
//     in-memory genome shape the file loader produces. Every record is validated through the
//     genome_schema Zod parsers exactly as the loader does; rows that fail parse are load
//     errors (LoadedGenome.load_errors — surfaced by system_health), never silent skips.
//     Writes ride the coltrane_genome_upsert RPC as the caller.
//
// No new dependencies: plain fetch, and the Zod schemas the engine already owns.
